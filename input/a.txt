In a response to Catalan's demands, limited autonomy was granted to Catalonia in 1913—abolished in 1920—and granted again in 1932 during the [[Second Spanish Republic]], when the [[Generalitat of Catalonia|Generalitat]], Catalonia's medieval institution of government, was restored. In fact, the constitution of 1931 envisaged a territorial division for all Spain in &quot;autonomous regions&quot;, which was never fully attained—only Catalonia, the Basque Country and Galicia had approved &quot;[[Statute of Autonomy|Statutes of Autonomy]]&quot;—the process being thwarted by the [[Spanish Civil War]] that broke out in 1936, and the victory of the rebel national forces under [[Francisco Franco]].

When Franco died in 1975, Spain entered into a phase of [[Spanish transition to democracy |transition towards democracy]], and the most difficult task of the newly democratically elected [[Cortes Generales]] (the Spanish Parliament) in 1977 acting as a Constituent Assembly was to transition from a unitary centralized State into a decentralized State&lt;ref name=colomer&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-54171792.html|title=The Spanish 'state of autonomies': non-institutional federalism.(Special Issue on Politics and Policy in Democratic Spain: No Longer Different?)|last=Colomer|first=Josep M.|work=[[West European Politics]]|date=1 October 1998|accessdate=7 October 2012}}{{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a way that would satisfy the demands of the peripheral nationalists.&lt;ref name=mundo&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elmundo.es/especiales/2005/06/espana/estatutos_autonomia/historia.html|title=Café para Todos|work=La España de las Autonomías.

An agreement was made so that the Generalitat would be restored and limited competences would be transfered while the constitution was still being written. Shortly after, the government allowed the creation of &quot;assemblies of members of parliament&quot; integrated by deputies and senators of the different territories of Spain, so that they could constitute &quot;pre-autonomic regimes&quot; for their regions as well. 

The [[Fathers of the Constitution]] had to strike a balance between the opposing views of Spain, on the one hand, the centralist view inherited from Franco's regime,&lt;ref name=colomer/&gt; and on the other hand [[federalism]] and a pluralistic view of Spain as a &quot;nation of nations&quot;;&lt;ref name=sinopsis2&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.congreso.es/consti/constitucion/indice/sinopsis/sinopsis.jsp?art=2&amp;tipo=2|title=Sinópsis artículo 2|work=Constitución española (con sinópsis) |last=Delgado-Ibarren García-Campero|first=Manuel| publisher=[[Congress of Deputies (Spain)|Congress of the Deputies]]|date=June 2005|accessdate=28 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; between a uniform decentralization of entities with the same competences and an asymmetrical structure that would distinguish the nationalities. (Peripheral nationalist parties wanted a multinational State with a federal or confederal model, whereas the governing [[Union of the Democratic Centre (Spain)|Union of the Democratic Center]] and the [[People's Alliance (Spain)|People's Alliance]] wanted minimum decentralization; the [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]] was sympathetic to a federal system).&lt;ref name=frans/&gt; In the end, the constitution, published and ratified in 1979, found a balance in recognizing the existence of &quot;nationalities and regions&quot; in Spain, in the &quot;indissoluble unity of the Spanish nation&quot;. While federalism was ruled out, the constitution guaranteed the right to autonomy or self-government of the said &quot;nationalities and regions&quot;, through a process of asymmetric [[devolution]] of power to the &quot;autonomous communities&quot; that were to be created.

===Constitution of 1978===
The starting point in the territorial organization of Spain was the second article of the constitution,&lt;ref name=perez&gt;{{cite web|url=http://books.google.com/books/about/El_Funcionamiento_Del_Estado_Autonomico.html?id=4SnZBb6pIZkC|work=El Funcionamiento del Estado Autonómico|title=Desarrollo y Evolución del Estado Autonómico: El Proceso Constituyente y el Consenso Constitucional|last=Pérez Royo|first=Javier|editor-last=Hernández Lafuente|editor-first=Adolfo|pages=50-67|publisher=Ministerio de Administraciones Públicas|date=December 1999|accessdate=7 October 2012|isbn=8470886908}}&lt;/ref&gt; which reads:

The constitution was rather ambiguous on how this was to take place.&lt;ref name=nunez/&gt;&lt;ref name=colomer/&gt; It does not define, detail, or impose the structure of the State;&lt;ref name=perez/&gt;&lt;ref name=portero/&gt; it does not tell the difference between &quot;nation&quot; and &quot;nationality&quot;; and it does not specify which are the &quot;nationalities&quot; and which are the &quot;regions&quot;, or the territories they comprise.&lt;ref name=perez/&gt;&lt;ref name=clavero&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fundacioncajamar.es/mediterraneo/revista/me1003.pdf|title=Un balance del Estado de las Autonomías|last=Clavero Arévalo|first=Manuel|work=Colección Mediterráneo Económico, num. 10.|publisher|Fundación Caja Rural Intermediterránea|isbn=4-95531-35-6|date=2006|accessdate=7 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than imposing, it ''enables'' a process towards a decentralized structure based on the exercise that these &quot;nationalities and regions&quot; would make of the right to self-government that they were granted.&lt;ref name=perez/&gt; As such, the outcome of this exercise was not predictable&lt;ref name=barberia&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sociedad.elpais.com/sociedad/2012/09/30/actualidad/1349028022_631925.html|title=¿Reformamos la Constitución?|last=Barbería|first=José Luis|date=30 September 2012|publisher=[[El País]]|accessdate=23 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its construction was deliberately open-ended;&lt;ref name=frans&gt;{{cite web|url=http://books.google.com/books/about/Regionalism_After_Regionalisation.html?id=u8gZklxHTMUC|title=Regionalism after Regionalisation.

Amsterdam University Press|date=30 June 2006|isbn=9056294288|accesdate=14 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the constitution only created a process for an eventual [[devolution]], but it was voluntary in nature: the &quot;nationalities and regions&quot; themselves had the option of choosing to attain self-government or not.&lt;ref name=sinopsis143&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.congreso.es/consti/constitucion/indice/sinopsis/sinopsis.jsp?art=143&amp;tipo=2|title=Sinópsis artículo 143|work=Constitución española (con sinópsis) |last=Alonso de Antonio|first=José Antonio| publisher=[[Congress of Deputies (Spain)|Congress of the Deputies]]|date=June 2003|accessdate=29 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to exercise this right, the constitution established an open process whereby the &quot;nationalities and regions&quot; could be constituted as &quot;autonomous communities&quot;. First, it recognized the pre-existing 50 [[provinces of Spain]], a territorial division of the liberal centralizing regime of the 19th century created for purely administrative purposes. (It also recognized the [[municipalities of Spain|municipalities]] that integrated the provinces). These provinces would serve as the building blocks and constituent parts of the autonomous communities. The constitution stipulated that the following could be constituted as autonomous communities:&lt;ref name=article143&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.congreso.es/consti/constitucion/indice/titulos/articulos.jsp?ini=143&amp;fin=158&amp;tipo=2|title=Título VIII. De la Organización Territorial del Estado. Capítulo tercero. De las Comunidades Autónomas. Artículos 143 a 158|author=Congreso de los Diputados|work=Constitución española|date=1978|accessdate=22 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* two or more adjacent provinces with common historical, cultural and economic characteristics,
* insular territories, or
* a single province with a &quot;historical regional identity&quot;.

It also allowed for exceptions to the above criteria, in that the Spanish Parliament could:&lt;ref name=article143/&gt;
* authorize, in the nation's interest, the constitution of an autonomous community even if it was a single province without a historical regional identity; and to
* authorize or grant autonomy to entities or territories that were not provinces.

The constitution also established two &quot;routes&quot; to accede to autonomy. The &quot;fast route&quot; or &quot;fast track&quot;,&lt;ref name=nunez/&gt; also called the &quot;exception&quot;,&lt;ref name=perez/&gt; was established in article 151, and was implicitly reserved for the three &quot;historical nationalities&quot;,&lt;ref name=clavero/&gt;&lt;ref name=sinopsisDT2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.congreso.es/consti/constitucion/indice/sinopsis/sinopsis.jsp?art=2&amp;tipo=4|title=Sinópsis Disposición Transitoria 2|publisher=[[Congress of Deputies]]|first=José Antonio|last=Alonso de Antonio|date=December 2003|accessdate=29 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tanja/&gt; in that the very strict requirements to opt for this route were waived via the second transitory disposition for those territories that had approved a &quot;Statute of Autonomy&quot; during the Second Spanish Republic.&lt;ref name=sinopsisDT2/&gt; (Otherwise, the constitution required the approval of three-fourths of the municipalities involved whose population would sum up at least the majority of the electoral census of each province and the ratification through a [[referendum]] with the affirmative vote of the absolute majority of the electoral census of each province—that is, of all registered citizens, not only of those who would vote). The constitution also explicitly established that the institutional framework for these communities would be a [[parliamentary system]], with a Legislative Assembly elected by [[universal suffrage]], a [[cabinet (government)|cabinet]] or &quot;council of government&quot;, a president of such a council, elected by the Assembly, and a Supreme Court of Justice. They were also granted a maximum level of devolved competences. 

The &quot;slow route&quot; or &quot;slow track&quot;,&lt;ref name=nunez/&gt; also called the &quot;norm&quot;,&lt;ref name=perez/&gt; was established in article 143. This route could be taken—via the first transitory disposition—by the &quot;pre-autonomic regimes&quot; that had been constituted in 1978, while the constitution was still being drafted, if approved by two-thirds of all municipalities involved whose population would sum up to at least the majority of the electoral census of each province or insular territory. These communities would assume limited competences during a provisional period of 5 years, after which they could assume further competences, upon negotiation with the central government. However, the constitution did not explicitly establish an institutional framework for these communities. They could have established a parliamentary system, or they could have not assumed any legislative powers and simply established mechanisms for the administration of the competences they were granted.&lt;ref name=clavero/&gt;&lt;ref name=perez/&gt;
[[File:Constitucion espanola 1978.JPG|thumb|Spanish Constitution of 1978]]
Once the autonomous communities were created, Article 145 prohibits the &quot;federation of autonomous communities&quot;.  This was understood as any agreement between communities that would produce an alteration to the political and territorial equilibrium that would cause a confrontation between different blocks of communities, an action incompatible with the principle of solidarity and the unity of the nation.&lt;ref name=gonzalez&gt;{{cite web|url=http://congreso.us.es/cidc/Ponencias/federalismo/IgnacioGonzalez.pdf|title=La Prohibición de la Federación entre Territorios Autónomos en el Constitucionalismo Español|last=González García|first=Ignacio|publisher=Congreso Iberoamericano de Derecho Constitucional|accessdate=20 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The so-called &quot;additional&quot; and  &quot;transitory&quot; dispositions of the constitution allowed for some exceptions to the above-mentioned framework. In terms of territorial organization, the fifth transitory disposition established that the cities of [[Ceuta]] and [[Melilla]], Spanish exclaves located on the northern coast of [[Africa]], could be constituted as &quot;autonomous communities&quot; if the absolute majority of the members of their city councils would agree on such a motion, and with the approval of the Spanish Parliament, which would exercise its prerogatives to grant autonomy to other entities besides provinces.&lt;ref name=transitorias&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.congreso.es/consti/constitucion/indice/titulos/articulos.jsp?ini=1&amp;fin=9&amp;tipo=4|title=Disposiciones transitorias|work=Constitución española|author=Congreso de los Diputados|date=1978|accessdate=22 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of the scope of competences, the first additional disposition recognized the historical rights of the &quot;chartered&quot; territories (in Spanish: ''territorios forales''), namely the Basque-speaking provinces, which were to be updated in accordance to the constitution.&lt;ref name=adicionales&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.congreso.es/consti/constitucion/indice/titulos/articulos.jsp?ini=1&amp;fin=4&amp;tipo=3|title=Disposiciones transitorias|work=Constitución española|author=Congreso de los Diputados|date=1978|accessdate=22 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This recognition would allow them to establish a financial &quot;[[communities of chartered regime|chartered regime]]&quot; whereby they would not only have independence to manage their own finances, like all other communities, but to have their own public financial ministries with the ability to levy and collect all taxes. In the rest of the communities, with a few exceptions, all taxes are collected by the central government and then redistributed.

===The autonomic pacts===
The Statutes of Autonomy of the Basque Country and Catalonia were sanctioned by the Spanish Parliament on 18 December 1979. The position of the party in government, the [[Union of the Democratic Centre (Spain)|Union of the Democratic Center]], (UCD), was that only the three &quot;historical nationalities&quot; would assume full competences, while the rest would accede to autonomy via article 143, assuming less powers and even not establishing institutions of government. This was firmly opposed by the representatives of [[Andalusia]], who demanded for their region the maximum level of competences granted to the &quot;nationalities&quot;.&lt;ref name=clavero/&gt; After a massive rally in support for autonomy, a referendum was organized for Andalusia to attain autonomy through the very strict requirements of article 151, or the &quot;fast route&quot;—with UCD calling for absention, and the main party in opposition in Parliament, the [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]] (PSOE) calling for a vote in favor—&lt;ref name=clavero/&gt; but these requirements were not met, in that in only one of the eight provinces, [[province of Almería|Almería]], votes in favor, although the majority, did not amount to half of the electoral census. Yet, the will of the Andalusian people had been clear and unequivocal.&lt;ref name=perez/&gt; After several months of discussion, the then prime minister of Spain, [[Adolfo Suárez]] and the leader of the opposition, [[Felipe González]], reached an agreement to resolve the Andalusian issue, whereby the Parliament approved an amendment to the law that regulated referendums, and used a prerogative of article 144c of the constitution, both actions which combined would allow Andalusia to take the fast route. They also agreed that no other region would take the &quot;fast route&quot;, but all would establish a parliamentary system with all institutions of government.&lt;ref name=clavero/&gt; This opened a phase that was dubbed as ''café para todos'', &quot;coffee for all&quot;.&lt;ref name=tanja/&gt; This agreement was eventually put into writing in July 1981 in what has been called the &quot;first autonomic pacts&quot;,&lt;ref name=nunez&gt;{{cite web|url=http://books.google.com/books/about/Spanish_History_since_1808.html?id=ogvsITQ0cmwC|title=The awakening of peripheral nationalisms and the State of the Autonomous Communities|last=Núñez Seixas|first=Xosé M|editor1-last=Álvarez Junco|editor1-first=José|editor2-last=Schubert|editor2-first=Adrian|work=Spanish History since 1808|publisher=Arnold Publishers|year=2000|accessdate=9 October 2008|page=315-330|isbn=0340662298}}&lt;/ref&gt; (in Spanish: ''pactos autonómicos'' or ''acuerdos autónomicos'').

These &quot;autonomic pacts&quot; filled in the gap left by the open character of the constitution.

* they described final outline of the territorial division of Spain, with the specific number and name of the autonomous communities to be created;
* they restricted the &quot;fast-route&quot; to the &quot;historical nationalities&quot; and Andalusia; all the rest had to take the &quot;slow-route&quot;;
* they established that all autonomous communities would have institutions of government within a parliamentary system; and 
* they set up a deadline for all communities to be constituted: 1 February 1983.

In the end, 17 autonomous communities were created:
* Andalusia, and the three &quot;historical nationalities&quot;—the Basque Country, Catalonia and Galicia—took the &quot;fast-route&quot; and assumed the maximum level of competences immediately; the rest took the &quot;slow route&quot;;
* [[Aragon]], [[Castile-La Mancha]], [[Castile and León]], [[Extremadura]] and the [[Valencian Community]] acceded to autonomy as communities integrated by two or more provinces with common historical, economic and cultural characteristics;
* the [[Balearic Islands]] and the [[Canary Islands]] acceded to autonomy as insular territories, the latter integrated by two provinces;
* [[Asturias]], [[Cantabria]], [[La Rioja (Spain)|La Rioja]] and [[Region of Murcia|Murcia]] acceded to autonomy as &quot;uniprovincial&quot; regions with historical idendity;
* [[Navarre]] acceded to autonomy through recognition, update and improvement of its historical &quot;charters&quot; (in Spanish: ''fueros''); and 
* the [[Community of Madrid]] was severed from Castile-La Mancha and constituted as a uniprovincial autonomous community in the nation's interest as the capital of the nation.

Special provisions were made for the Valencian Community and the Canary Islands in that, although they took the &quot;slow route&quot;, through the subsequent approval of specific organic laws, they were to assume the maximum level of competences, since they have started a process towards the &quot;fast route&quot; prior to the approval of the &quot;autonomic pacts&quot;.

[[File:Congreso de los Diputados (España) 14.jpg|thumb|Spanish Parliament, Congress of Deputies]]
During the second half of the 1980s, the central government seemed reluctant to transfer all competences to the &quot;slow route&quot; communities.&lt;ref name=mundo/&gt; After the five years set up by the constitution, all &quot;slow route&quot; communities demanded the maximum transfer guaranteed by the constitution. This led to what has been called the &quot;second autonomic pacts&quot; of 1992, between the then prime minister of Spain [[Felipe González]] from PSOE and the leader of the opposition, [[José María Aznar]] from the newly created [[People's Party (Spain)|People's Party]] (PP) successor of the [[People's Alliance (Spain)|People's Alliance party]]. Through these agreements new competences were transfered, with the reforms to many Statutes of Autonomy of the &quot;slow-route&quot; communities with the aim of &quot;equalizing&quot; them to the &quot;fast route&quot; communities.&lt;ref name=mundo/&gt; Finally, in 1995, the cities of Ceuta and Melilla were constituted as &quot;autonomous cities&quot;, with no legislative powers, but with an autonomous assembly not subordinated to any other province or community. 

The creation of the autonomous communities was a diverse process, that started with the constitution, was normalized with the autonomic pacts and was completed with the Statutes of Autonomy.&lt;ref name=perez/&gt; It is, however, an ongoing process; further devolution—or even the return of transferred competences—is always a possibility. This has been evidenced in the 2000s, at the beginning with a wave of approval of new Statutes of Autonomy for many communities, and more recently with many considering the recentralization of some competences in the wake of the economic and financial crisis of 2008. Nonetheless Spain is now a highly decentralized country with a structure unlike any other, similar but not equal to a [[federation]],&lt;ref name=perez/&gt; in what has been called a &quot;State of autonomies&quot;.

===Current state of affairs===
Peripheral nationalism continues to play a key role in Spanish politics. Some peripheral nationalists view that there is a vanishing practical distinction between the terms &quot;nationalities&quot; and &quot;regions&quot;,&lt;ref name=keatings&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/61/8/37890628.pdf |title=Federalism and the Balance of power in European States|first=Michael|last=Keatings  |year=2007 |work=Support for Improvement in Governance and Management |publisher=[[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]], Inc.  |accessdate=28 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; as more competences are transferred to all communities in roughly the same degree and as other communities to chose to identify themselves as &quot;nationalities&quot;.  In fact, it has been argued that the establishment of the State of autonomies&quot; has led to the creation of &quot;new regional identities&quot;,&lt;ref name=smith/&gt;&lt;ref name=junco&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elpais.com/elpais/2012/09/28/opinion/1348855849_016658.html|title=El sueño ilustrado y el Estado-nación|last=Junco|first=José Álvarez|publisher=[[El País]]|date=3 October 2012|accessdate=23 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;invented communities&quot;.&lt;ref name=junco/&gt; Many in the Basque Country and Catalonia still view their communities as &quot;nations&quot;, not just &quot;nationalities&quot;, and Spain as a &quot;plurinational State&quot; or a &quot;nation of nations&quot;, and they have made more demands for further devolution.  In 2004, the Basque Parliament approved the [[Ibarretxe Plan]], whereby the Basque Country would approve a new Statute of Autonomy containing key provisions such as shared sovereignty with Spain, full independence of the [[judiciary]] and the right to [[self-determination]], and assuming all competences except that of the [[Spanish nationality law]], defense and monetary policy. The Plan was rejected by the Spanish Parliament in 2005. In 2006, the Catalan Parliament approved a new Statute of Autonomy which included an article that defined Catalonia as a &quot;nation&quot;. The Spanish Parliament made revisions to the final approved version, removing the article, but making a reference in the preamble of the document to the fact that the Catalan Parliament had voted by a large majority to define Catalonia as a nation, but that the constitution recognizes its &quot;national reality&quot; as a &quot;nationality&quot;.&lt;ref name=estatut&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parlament.cat/porteso/estatut/estatut_angles_100506.pdf|title=Organic Law 6/2006 of the 19th July, on the Reform of the Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia|publisher=[[Generalitat of Catalonia]]|date=2006|accessdate=21 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The severe economic crisis in Spain that started in 2008 has produced different reactions in the different communities. One one hand, politicians in some of the communities that are not &quot;nationalities&quot; and governed by the People's Party (PP) are considering a return of some competences to the central government.&lt;ref name=abc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.es/20110729/espana/abcp-varias-autonomias-meditan-devolver-20110729.html|title=Varias autonomías meditan devolver competencias por el bloqueo del gobierno|publisher=[[ABC (Spain)|ABC]]|date=29 July 2011|accessdate=29 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, in Catalonia, the party in power, [[Convergence and Union]] (CiU), views the &quot;unfairness&quot; of the large fiscal deficit—Catalonia,  being one of the largest net contributors in taxes—as one of the main causes of the strenuous fiscal situation that has allegedly forced the government to enact severe austerity measures and defer payments to workers.&lt;ref name=paisindep&gt;{{cite web|url=http://politica.elpais.com/politica/2012/09/14/actualidad/1347653709_791863.html|title=Independentismo de corazón y de conveniencia|last=Pérez Oliva|first=Milagros|publisher=[[El País]]|date=16 September 2012|accessdate=16 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This, in turn, has led many who are not necessarily separatist but who are enraged by the financial deficit to support secession.&lt;ref name=nextstate&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/node/21563347|title=Catalonia: Europe's next state.

==Constitutional and statutory framework==
The State of Autonomies, as established in Article 2 of the constitution, has been argued to be based on four principles: willingness to accede to autonomy, unity in diversity, autonomy but not sovereignty of the communities, and solidarity among them all.&lt;ref name=carreras/&gt; The structure of the autonomous communities is determined both by the devolution allowed by the constitution and the competences assumed in their respective Statutes of Autonomy. While the autonomic agreements and other laws have allowed for an &quot;equalization&quot; of all communities, differences still remain. 

===The Statute of Autonomy===
{{main|Statute of Autonomy}}
The Statute of Autonomy is the basic institutional law of the autonomous community or city, recognized by the Spanish constitution in article 147. It is approved by a parliamentary assembly representing the community, and then approved by the [[Cortes Generales]], the Spanish Parliament, through an &quot;Organic Law&quot;, requiring the favorable vote of the absolute majority of the [[Congress of Deputies (Spain)|Congress of Deputies]]. For communities that acceded to autonomy through the &quot;fast route&quot;, a [[referendum]] is required before it can be sanctioned by the Parliament. The Statutes of Autonomy must contain, at least, the name of the community, its territorial limits, the names, organization and seat of the institutions of government, the competences they assume and the principles for their bilingual policy, if applicable. 

The constitution establishes that all competences not explicitly assumed by the State—the central government—in the constitution, can be assumed by the autonomous community in their Statutes of Autonomy; but also, all competences not explicitly assumed by the autonomous community in their Statutes of Autonomy are automatically assumed by the State.&lt;ref name=article143/&gt; In case of conflict, the constitution prevails.&lt;ref name=article143/&gt; In case of disagreement, any administration can bring the case before the [[Constitutional Court of Spain]].

===Institutional organization===
All autonomous communities have a parliamentary system based on a division of powers comprising:
* a Legislative Assembly, whose members are elected by universal suffrage according to a system of [[proportional representation]], in which all areas that integrate the territory are fairly represented;
* a Council of Government, with executive and administrative powers, headed by a &quot;president&quot;, elected by the Legislative Assembly—usually the leader of the party or coalition with a majority in the Assembly—and nominated by the [[King of Spain]];
* a Supreme Court of Justice, hierarchically under the Supreme Court of Justice of Spain.

The majority of the communities have approved regional electoral laws within the limits set up by the laws for the entire country. Despite minor differences, all communities use [[proportional representation]] following [[D'Hondt method]]; all members of regional parliaments are elected for four year terms, but the president of the community has the faculty to dissolve the legislature and call for early elections. Nonetheless in all communities, with the exception of the Basque Country, Catalonia, Galicia and Andalusia, elections are celebrated the last Sunday of May every four years, concurrent with municipal elections in all Spain.&lt;ref name=carreras&gt;{{cite web|url=http://books.google.com/books/about/Descentralizaci%C3%B3n_en_Perspectiva_Compar.html?id=zkclm60b_yoC|first=Francesc|last=de Carreras Serra|title=El Estado de las Autonomías en España|work=Descentralización en Perspectiva Comparada: España, Colombia y Brasil|author=Instituto Latinoamericano de Investigaciones Sociales|publisher=Plural Editores|date=2005|accessdate=12 October 2012|isbn=9990563578}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The names of the Council of Government and the Legislative Assembly vary between communities. In some autonomous communities, these institutions are restored historical bodies of government or representation of the previous kingdoms or regional entities within the Spanish crown—like the [[Generalitat of Catalonia]]— while others are entirely new creations. In some, both the executive and the legislature, though constituting two separate institutions, are collectively identified with a single specific name. It should be noted, though, that a specific denomination may not refer to the same branch of government in all communities; for example, &quot;Junta&quot; may refer to the executive office in some communities, to the legislature in others, or to the collective name of all branches of government in others.

Given the ambiguity in the constitution that did not specify which territories were nationalities and which were regions, other territories, besides the implicit three &quot;historical nationalities&quot;, have also chosen to identify themselves as nationalities, in accordance to their historical regional identity, such as Andalusia, Aragon, the Balearic Islands, the Canary Islands and the Valencian Community.

The two autonomous cities have more limited competences than autonomous communities, but more than other municipalities. The executive is exercised by a president, which is also the major of the city. In the same way, limited legislative power is vested in a local assembly in which the deputies are also the city councilors.

===Competences===
The autonomic agreements of 1982 and 1992 tried to equalize competences devolved to the 17 autonomous communities,  within the limits of the constitution and the differences guaranteed by it.

The autonomic regime is characterized by an equilibrium between homogeneity and diversity [...] Without the former there will be no unity or integration in the State's ensemble; without the latter, there would not be [a] true plurality and the capacity of self-government.&quot;&lt;ref name=sinopsis137&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.congreso.es/consti/constitucion/indice/sinopsis/sinopsis.jsp?art=137&amp;tipo=2|title=Sinópsis artículo 137|first=Julio|last=Castelao|work=Constitución española (con sinópsis)| publisher=[[Congress of Deputies (Spain)|Congress of the Deputies]]|date=June 2005|accessdate=14 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The asymmetrical devolution is a unique characteristic of the territorial structure of Spain, in that the different constituent territorial entities of the country have different powers. These were based on what has been called in Spanish as ''hechos diferenciales'', &quot;differential facts&quot; or &quot;differential traits&quot;.&lt;ref name=aja&gt;{{cite web|url=http://congreso.us.es/cidc/Ponencias/federalismo/eliseo%20AJA.pdf|title=El Estado Autonómico de España a los 25 años de su constitución|last=Aja|first=Eliseo|publisher=Congreso Ibeoramericano de Derecho Constitucional|date=2003|accessdate=22 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This expression refers to the idea that some communities have particular traits, with respect to Spain as a whole. In practice these traits are a native &quot;language proper to their own territories&quot; separate from Spanish, a particular financial regime or special civil rights expressed in a code, which generate a distinct political personality.&lt;ref name=aja/&gt; These ''hechos diferenciales'' of their distinct political and historical personality are constitutionally and statutorily (i.e. in their Statutes of Autonomy) recognized in the exceptions granted to some of them and the additional competences they assume.&lt;ref name=aja/&gt;

Competences can be divided into three groups: exclusive to the central State or central government, shared competences, and devolved competences exclusive to the communities. Article 149 states which powers are exclusive to the central government: international relations, defense, administration of justice, commercial, criminal, civil and labor legislation, customs, general finances and State debt, public health, basic legislation and general coordination.&lt;ref name=fiscal/&gt; All autonomous communities have the power to manage their own finances in the way they see fit, and are responsible for the administration of education—school and universities—health and social services and cultural and urban development.&lt;ref name=howmuch&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/node/12501023|title=How much is enough? Devolution has been good for Spain, but it may have gone too far|publisher=[[The Economist]]|date=6 November 2008|accessdate=14 October 2012}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet there are differences as stipulated in their Statutes and the constitution:&lt;ref name=carreras/&gt; Aragon, the Balearic Islands, the Basque Country, Catalonia, Galicia and the Valencian Community have a regional civil code; the Basque Country, Catalonia and Navarre have their own police corps—the [[Ertzaintza]], the [[Mossos d'Esquadra]] and the [[Policía Foral|Nafarroako Foruzainoga]], respectively—; the Canary Islands have a special financial regime in virtue of its location as an overseas territories, while the Basque Country and Navarre have a distinct financial regime called &quot;chartered regime&quot;; and finally, the Balearic Islands, the Basque Country, Catalonia, Galicia, Navarre and the Valencian Community have a co-official language and therefore a distinct linguistic regime.&lt;ref name=carreras/&gt;

===Financial regimes===
{{see also|Communities of chartered regime}}
How the communities are financed has been one of the most contentious aspects in their relationship with the central government.&lt;ref name=smith/&gt; The constitution gave all communities significant control over spending, but the central government retained effective control of their financing,&lt;ref name=smith/&gt; that is, the central State is still charge of levying and collecting most taxes, which it then redistributes with the aim of producing &quot;fiscal equalization&quot;&lt;ref name=fiscal&gt;{{cite web|url=http://books.google.com/books/about/Fiscal_Federalism_and_Political_Decentra.html?id=ngoAEwlqMIsC|work=Fiscal Federalism and Political Decentralization: Lessons from Spain, Germany and Canada|editor1-last=Bosch|editor1-first=Núria|editor2-last=Durán|editor2-first=José María|last1=Ruíz-Huerta Carbonell|first1=Jesús|last2=Herrero Alcalde|first2=Ana|title=Fiscal Equalization in Spain|publisher=Edward Elgar Publisher Limited|year=2008|isbn=9781847204677|accessdate=15 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This applies to all communities, with the exception of the Basque Country and Navarre. This financial scheme is known as the &quot;common regime&quot;. In essence, &quot;fiscal equalization&quot; implies that richer communities become net contributors to the system, while poorer communities become net recipients. The two largest net contributors to the system are the Balearic Islands and the Community of Madrid, in percentage terms, or the Community of Madrid and Catalonia in absolute terms.&lt;ref name=fiscal/&gt;&lt;ref name=cinco&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cincodias.com/articulo/economia/madrid-aporta-estado-doble-cataluna/20071129cdscdieco_1/|title=Madrid aporta al Estado más del doble que Cataluña|publisher=Cinco Días|date=29 November 2007|accessdate=1 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Central funding is the main source of revenue for the communities of &quot;common regime&quot;. Redistribution, or transfer payments, is given to the communities of common regime to manage the competences they have assumed and the amount is based on several calculations that take into account, which include a consideration for population, land area, administrative units, dispersal of population, relative poverty, fiscal pressure and insularity.&lt;ref name=tanja/&gt; The central government is committed to returning a specific percentage of taxes to all communities with common regime, within the differences allowed for &quot;fiscal equalization&quot;. The communities of common regime have the ability to add a surcharge to the so-called &quot;ceded taxes&quot;—taxes set at the central level, but collected locally—and they can lower or raise personal income taxes up to a limit.&lt;ref name=smith/&gt;

The Basque Country and Navarre were granted an exception in the fiscal and financial system through the first additional disposition of the constitution that recognizes their the historical &quot;charters&quot; (in Spanish: ''fueros'')—hence they are known as &quot;[[communities of chartered regime]]&quot; or &quot;foral regime&quot;.&lt;ref name=smith/&gt; Through their &quot;chartered regime&quot;, these communities are allowed to levy and collect all so-called &quot;contracted taxes&quot;, including income tax and corporate tax, and they have much more flexibility to lower or raise them.&lt;ref name=smith/&gt; This &quot;chartered&quot; or &quot;foral&quot; contract entails true financial autonomy.&lt;ref name=smith/&gt; Since they collect almost all taxes, they send to the central government a pre-arranged amount known as ''cupo'', &quot;quota&quot; or ''aportación'', &quot;contribution&quot;, and the treaty whereby this system is recognized is known as ''concierto'', &quot;treaty&quot;, or ''convenio'', &quot;pact&quot;.&lt;ref name=hacienda&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.minhap.gob.es/es-ES/Areas%20Tematicas/Financiacion%20Autonomica/Paginas/Regimen%20foral.aspx|title=Régimen foral|author=Ministerio de Hacienda y Administraciones Públicas (Ministry of the Treasury and Public Administrations)|accessdate=1 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence they are also said to have ''concierto económico'', an &quot;economic treaty&quot;. Since they collect all taxes themselves and only send a prearranged amount to the central government for the competences exclusive to the State, they do not participate in &quot;fiscal equalization&quot;, in that they do not receive any money back. 

As more competences have been assumed by the autonomous communities, such as social welfare, health and education, public expenditure patterns have seen a shift from the central administration towards the communities since the 1980s.&lt;ref name=smith/&gt; In the late 2000s, autonomous communities accounted for 35% of all public expenditure in Spain, a percentage that is even higher than that of states within a federation.&lt;ref name=fiscal/&gt; However, with no legal constraints to balance budgets, and since the cenral government retains control over fiscal revenue in the communities of common regime, these are in a way encouraged to build up debts.&lt;ref name=smith/&gt; The [[Council on Fiscal and Financial Policy]], which includes representatives of the central government and of the autonomous communities, has become one of the most efficient institutions of coordination in matters of public expenditures and revenue.&lt;ref name=toboso&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-870986501.html|title=Un Primer Análisis Cuantitativo de la Organización Territorial de las Tareas de Gobierno en España, Alemania y Suiza|last=Toboso|first=Fernando|publisher=El Trimestre Económico|date=1 April 2001|accessdate=21 October 2012}}{{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the Council several agreements of financing have been agreed, as well as limits to the communities' public debt. The Organic Law of the Financing of Autonomous Communities of 1988 requires that the communities obtain the authorization of the central Ministry of Finance to issue public debt.&lt;ref name=toboso/&gt;

===Linguistic regimes===

Article 3 of the constitution ends up declaring that the &quot;richness of the distinct linguistic modalities of Spain represent a patrimony which will be the object of special respect and protection.&quot;&lt;ref name=third&gt;Third article. {{cite web |url=http://www.tribunalconstitucional.es/en/constitucion/Pages/ConstitucionIngles.aspx#i1 |title=Spanish Constitution |author=[[Cortes Generales]] |date=27 December 1978 |work= |publisher=Tribunal Constitucional de España |accessdate=28 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It must be noted that Spanish remains the only official language of the State; other languages are only co-official with Spanish in the communities that have so regulated. In addition, knowledge of the Spanish language was declared a right and an obligation of all Spaniards.

Spanish legislation, most notably in the Statutes of Autonomy of the bilingual communities, use the term &quot;language proper to a community&quot; (in Spanish: ''lengua propia'', oftentimes translated as &quot;own language&quot;) to refer to a language different from Spanish that originated or had historical roots in that particular territory. The Statutes of Autonomy of the respective autonomous communities have declared [[Basque language|Basque]] the language proper to the Basque Country and Navarre, [[Catalan language|Catalan]] the language proper to Catalonia, the Balearic Islands and the Valencian Community—where it is historically, traditionally and officially known as [[Valencian language|Valencian]]—, and [[Galician language|Galician]] to be the language proper to Galicia. There are other protected regional language in other autonomous communities. As a percentage of total population in Spain, Basque is spoken by 2%, Catalan by 17% and Galician by 7% of all Spaniards.&lt;ref name=cia&gt;{{cite web|https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/sp.html|title=Spain|work=The CIA World Factbook|publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]]|accessdate=22 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subdivisions===
{{see also|provinces of Spain|municipalities of Spain|comarques of Catalonia|vegueries}}

The Spanish constitution recognizes the [[municipalities of Spain|municipalities]] and guarantees their autonomy. Town halls (in Spanish: ''ayuntamientos'') are in charge of the municipalities' government and administration, and they are integrated by a major (in Spanish ''alcalde'') and councilors (in Spanish: ''concejales''), the latter elected by universal sufrage, and the former elected either by the councilor or by sufrage. 

Provinces are groups of municipalities and recognized by the constitution. Their competences and institutions of government vary greatly among communities. In all communities integrated by more than province, provinces are governed by &quot;Provincial Deputations&quot; (in Spanish: ''Diputaciones Provinciales''), with a limited scope administrative competences. In the Basque Country, the provinces, renamed as &quot;[[historical territories]]&quot; (in Spanish: ''territorios históricos'', in Basque: ''lurralde historiko''), are governed by &quot;Chartered Deputations&quot; (in Spanish: ''Diputaciones Forales'', in Basque: ''Foru Aldundi'')—with assume the competences of a provincial deputation as well as the fiscal powers of their &quot;[[communities of chartered regime|chartered regime]]—and by &quot;General Juntas&quot; (in Spanish: ''Juntas Generales'', in Basque: ''Biltzar Nagusiak'')—parliaments with legislative powers. In the Canary Islands and the Balearic Islands, each major island is governed by an &quot;Insular Council&quot; (in Spanish: ''Consejo Insular'' or ''Cabildo Insular'', in Catalan: ''Consell Insular''). In Catalonia, the &quot;Provincial Deputations&quot; have very little power,&lt;ref name=smith&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/spp/publications/unit-publications/64.pdf|title=Regional Government in France and Spain|last1=Smith|first1=Andy|last2=Heywood|first2=Paul|publisher=University College London|date=August 2000|accessdate=20 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; as other territorial subdivisions have been created. Finally, in those seven autonomous communities formed by a single province, the Provincial Deputations have been replaced by the communities' institutions of government; in fact, the provinces themselves are not only coterminous with the communities, but correspond in essence to the communities themselves. The two-tier territorial organization common to most communities—first province, then municipalities—is therefore non-existent in these &quot;uniprovincial&quot; communities.&lt;ref name=fiscal/&gt;

The constitution also allows the creation of other territorial entities formed by groups of municipalities. As of 2012, the only community that has created such subdivisions with a legal identity and administrative powers is Catalonia: the [[comarques of Catalonia|comarques]] (sing. ''comarca'') are associations of municipalities, and the [[vegueries]] (sing. ''vegueria'') are associations of comarques. Other communities recognize the existence of &quot;historical&quot; comarcas (sing. ''comarca''), with no administrative powers.

'''''Andalucia''''' is the fourth studio album by Los Angeles rock band [[Tito &amp; Tarantula]], released in 2002. The album marked several line-up changes in the band, which had previously consisted of lead singer/rhythm guitarist [[Tito Larriva]], lead guitarist [[Peter Atanasoff]], and drummer [[Johnny &quot;Vatos&quot; Hernandez]]. This album featured the debut of lead guitarist [[Steven Hufsteter]] - who had previously played with Larriva in the [[Cruzados]], bassist [[Io Perry]], and keyboardist [[Marcus Praed]].

The band toured promoting the album for several years. They also filmed a music video for the song &quot;California Girl&quot;. However, upon seeing how bad the footage of the video was, Perry threw up, Larriva threatened to quit, and Atanasoff was not seen around for days. So, to compensate, Larriva made his own video for the song using the eight dollars he had in his pocket. In the last 40 seconds of the song &quot;Effortless&quot;, Larriva, Atanasoff, and Perry can be heard laughing while they watch the &quot;California Girl&quot; music video.

The '''Battle of Tsushima''' ([[Japanese language|Japanese]]: 対馬海戦, ''tsushima-kaisen'', {{lang-ru|Цусимское сражѣніе}}, ''Tsusimskoye srazheniye''), commonly known as the ''“Sea of Japan Naval Battle”'' (Japanese: 日本海海戦, ''nihonkai-kaisen'') in [[Japan]] and the ''“Battle of Tsushima Strait”'', was the major naval battle fought between Russia and Japan during the [[Russo-Japanese War]]. This was naval history's only decisive sea battle fought by modern steel [[battleship]] fleets,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=RBC2nY1rp5MC&amp;pg=PA459&amp;dq=%22battle+of+tsushima%22+decisive+sea+battle#v=onepage&amp;q=%22battle%20of%20tsushima%22%20decisive%20sea%20battle&amp;f=false|page=459|title= Military communications: from ancient times to the 21st century |first=Christopher H. |last=Sterling |publisher= ABC-CLIO|year= 2008 |isbn= 1-85109-732-5|quote=''The naval battle of Tsushima, the ultimate contest of the 1904–1905 Russo-Japanese War, was one of the most decisive sea battles in history.''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= http://books.google.com/books?id=zUP23aBHLOwC&amp;pg=SL22-PA76&amp;dq=%22battle+of+tsushima%22+decisive+sea+battle#v=onepage&amp;q=%22battle%20of%20tsushima%22%20decisive%20sea%20battle&amp;f=false |quote=''In retrospect, the battle of Tsushima in May 1905 was the last &quot;decisive&quot; naval battle in history.''|page= V-76|title=Joint Operational Warfare Theory and Practice and V. 2, Historical Companion|editor= Naval War College Press (U.S.) |publisher= Government Printing Office|year= 2009 |isbn= 1-884733-62-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first naval battle in which [[wireless telegraphy]] played a critically important role, and has been characterized as the &quot;dying echo of the old era – for the last time in the history of naval warfare ships of the line of a beaten fleet surrendered on the high seas.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Brown p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

It was fought on May 27–28, 1905 (May 14–15 in the [[Julian calendar]] then in use in Russia) in the [[Tsushima Strait]] between [[Korea]] and southern [[Japan]]. In this battle the [[Japan]]ese fleet under Admiral [[Tōgō Heihachirō]] destroyed two-thirds of the [[Russia]]n fleet, under Admiral [[Zinovy Rozhestvensky]], which had traveled over {{convert|18000|nmi|km|lk=in}}  to reach the Far East. In London in 1906, [[Sir George Sydenham Clarke]] wrote, &quot;The battle of Tsu-shima is by far the greatest and the most important naval event since Trafalgar&quot;;&lt;ref&gt;Semenoff (1907) p. ix&lt;/ref&gt; decades later, historian [[Edmund Morris (writer)|Edmund Morris]] maintained that it remained the greatest naval battle since [[Battle of Trafalgar|Trafalgar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Morris|first=Edmund|authorlink=Edmund Morris (writer)|title=[[Theodore Rex (book)|Theodore Rex]]|isbn=0-394-55509-0|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the [[Russo-Japanese War]], countries constructed their battleships with mixed batteries of mainly 152&amp;nbsp;mm (6-inch), 203&amp;nbsp;mm (8-inch), 254&amp;nbsp;mm (10-inch) and 305&amp;nbsp;mm (12-inch) guns, with the intent that these battleships fight on the battle line in a close-quarter, decisive fleet action. The Battle of Tsushima demonstrated that battleship speed and big guns&lt;ref&gt;Massie p. 470-480&lt;/ref&gt; with longer ranges were more advantageous in naval battles than mixed batteries of different sizes.&lt;ref&gt;Semenoff (1907) p. 124, 135&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[wireless telegraph]] was invented in the last half of the 1890s, and by the turn of the century all major navies were adopting this improved communications technology. Although [[Alexander Stepanovich Popov]] of the Naval Warfare Institute had built and demonstrated a wireless telegraphy set in 1900, equipment from the firm [[Telefunken]] in Germany was initially adopted by the Imperial Russian Navy. In Japan, Professor Shunkichi Kimura was commissioned into the Imperial Navy to develop their own wireless system, and this was in place on many of the Japanese warships before 1904. Although both sides had early wireless telegraphy, the Russians were using German sets and had difficulties in their use and maintenance, while the Japanese had the advantage of using their own equipment. It is recognized today that this battle was the beginning of [[electronic warfare]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sarkar|first=Tapan K.|authorlink=Tapan Sarkar (writer)|title=[[History of Wireless (book)|History of Wireless]]|isbn=0-471-71814-9|year=2006}} p. 459&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

===Conflict in the Far East===
On 8 February 1904 destroyers of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] launched a surprise attack on the Russian Far East Fleet anchored in [[Lüshunkou|Port Arthur]]; 3 ships—2 battleships and a cruiser—were damaged in the attack. The Russo-Japanese war had thus begun. Japan's first objective was to secure its lines of communication and supply to the Asian mainland, enabling it to conduct a ground war in Manchuria. To achieve this, it was necessary to neutralise Russian naval power in the Far East. At first, the Russian naval forces remained inactive and did not engage the Japanese, who staged unopposed landings in Korea. However, the Russians were revitalised by the arrival of Admiral [[Stepan Makarov]] and were able to achieve some degree of success against the Japanese. Admiral Makarov's flagship, the battleship ''[[Russian battleship Petropavlovsk (1897)|Petropavlovsk]]'' struck a mine, and Makarov was among the dead. His successors failed to challenge the Japanese Navy, and the Russians were effectively bottled up in their base at Port Arthur.

By May, the Japanese had landed forces on the [[Liaodong Peninsula]] and in August began the [[siege of Port Arthur|siege of the naval station]]. On 9 August, Admiral [[Wilgelm Vitgeft]], commander of the 1st Pacific Squadron, was ordered to sortie his fleet to Vladivostok,&lt;ref&gt;Forczyk p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; link up with the Squadron stationed there, and then engage the [[Imperial Japanese Navy|IJN]] in decisive battle.&lt;ref&gt;Forczyk p. 26 &amp; 54&lt;/ref&gt; Both squadrons of the [[Russian Pacific Fleet]] would ultimately become dispersed during the battles of the [[Battle of the Yellow Sea|Yellow Sea]] on 10 August and the [[Battle off Ulsan|Ulsan]] on 14 August 1904. What remained of Russian naval power would eventually be sunk in [[Lüshunkou|Port Arthur]].

===''The Second Pacific Squadron''===
[[File:Battle of Japan Sea (Route of Baltic Fleet) NT.PNG|thumb|300px|The long voyage by the Russian Baltic Fleet]]
{{More footnotes|section|date=May 2010}}
With the inactivity of the First Pacific Squadron after the death of Admiral Makarov and the tightening of the Japanese noose around Port Arthur, the Russians considered sending part of their [[Baltic Fleet]] to the Far East. The plan was to relieve Port Arthur by sea, link up with the First Pacific Squadron, overwhelm the Imperial Japanese Navy, and then delay the Japanese advance into Manchuria until Russian reinforcements could arrive via the [[Trans-Siberian railroad]] and overwhelm the Japanese land forces in Manchuria. As the situation in the Far East deteriorated, the Tsar (encouraged by his cousin [[Kaiser Wilhelm II]]), agreed to the formation of the ''Second Pacific Squadron''. It would consist of five divisions of the Baltic Fleet, including 11 of its 13 battleships. The squadron departed on 15 October 1904 under the command of Admiral [[Zinovy Rozhestvensky]].

The Second Pacific Squadron sailed through the North Sea. As there were rumours of Japanese torpedo boats in the North Sea, several Russian ships fired upon British fishing trawlers off [[Dogger Bank incident|Dogger Bank]], causing the Royal Navy to shadow the Russian fleet until a diplomatic agreement was reached. Barred by Britain from using the [[Suez Canal]], the Russians sailed around Africa, and by April and May 1905 had anchored at [[Cam Ranh Bay]] in French Indochina. The voyage was long and arduous, and the [[morale]] of the crews plummeted. The Russians had been ordered to break the blockade of Port Arthur, but the city had already fallen on 2 January, so the Russian port of [[Vladivostok]] became the objective.

===Tsushima Strait===
[[File:TsuShima Strait.png|thumb|Korea and Tsushima Straits and Tsushima Islands]]
The Russians could have sailed through any one of three possible straits to reach Vladivostok: [[La Perouse Strait|La Perouse]], [[Tsugaru Strait|Tsugaru]], and Tsushima. Admiral Rozhestvensky chose Tsushima in an effort to simplify his route. Admiral Tōgō, based at [[Busan]], also believed Tsushima would be the preferred Russian course. Tsushima Strait is the body of water eastward of the [[Tsushima Island]] group, located midway between the Japanese island of Kyushu and the Korean Peninsula, the shortest and most direct route from Indochina. The other routes would have required the fleet to sail east around Japan. The Japanese Combined Fleet and the Russian Second and Third Pacific Squadrons, sent from Europe, would fight in the straits between Korea and Japan near the Tsushima Islands.

==Prelude==
{{Main|Tsushima Strait order of battle}}

Because of the 18,000-mile journey, the Russian fleet was in relatively poor condition for battle. Apart from the four newest [[Borodino class battleship|''Borodino'' class battleships]], Admiral Nebogatov's 3rd Division&lt;ref&gt;Forczyk p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; consisted of older and poorly-maintained warships. Overall neither side had a significant maneuverability advantage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Forczyk p. 33&quot;&gt;Forczyk p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; The long voyage, combined with a lack of opportunity for maintenance, meant Russian ships were heavily [[biofouling|fouled]], significantly reducing their speed.&lt;ref&gt;Forczyk, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; The Japanese ships could reach {{convert|15|kn|km/h|lk=in}}, but the Russian fleet could reach just {{convert|14|kn|km/h}}, only in short bursts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Forczyk p. 33&quot;/&gt;

Tōgō was able to use the superior maneuverability of his fleet to advantage, &quot;[[crossing the T]]&quot; twice. Additionally, there were significant deficiencies in the Russian naval fleet's equipment and training. Russian naval tests with their torpedoes exposed major technological failings.&lt;ref&gt;In one such trial, of the seven torpedoes fired, one jammed in the tube, two veered ninety degrees to port, one went ninety degrees to starboard, two kept a steady course but went wide of the mark, and the last went round in circles 'popping up and down like a porpoise', causing panic throughout the fleet.&quot; Regan, Geoffrey; ''The Guiness Book of Decisive Battles'', 'The Battle of Tsushima 1905', p.176&lt;/ref&gt; Tōgō's greatest advantage was that of experience, being the only active admiral in any navy with combat experience aboard battleships.&lt;ref&gt;Forczyk 8, 43, 73 &amp; back cover&lt;/ref&gt; (The others were Russian Admirals [[Oskar Victorovich Stark]], who had been relieved of command following his humiliating loss in the [[Battle of Port Arthur]], and [[Wilgelm Vitgeft]], who had been killed in the [[Battle of the Yellow Sea]].)

==Battle==
&lt;!--===Japanese plans=== --&gt;

===Naval tactics===
Battleships, cruisers, and other vessels were arranged into divisions, each division being commanded by a Flag Officer (Admiral). At the battle of Tsushima, Admiral Tōgō was the officer commanding in ''[[Japanese battleship Mikasa|Mikasa]]'' (the other divisions being commanded by Vice Admirals, Rear Admirals, Commodores, Captains and Commanders for the destroyer divisions). Next in line after ''Mikasa'' came the battleships ''[[Japanese battleship Shikishima|Shikishima]]'', ''[[Japanese battleship Fuji|Fuji]]'' and ''[[Japanese battleship Asahi|Asahi]]''. Following them were two armoured cruisers.
[[File:MIKASAGUNS.jpg|thumb|upright|The battleship ''[[Japanese battleship Mikasa|Mikasa]]'', Admiral [[Tōgō Heihachirō|Tōgō]]'s flagship at the battle of Tsushima, preserved as a memorial in Yokosuka, Japan]]

Admiral Tōgō, by using reconnaissance and choosing his position well, &quot;secured beyond reasonable hazard his strategic objective of bringing the Russian fleet to battle, irrespective of speeds.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Mahan p. 456&lt;/ref&gt;  When Tōgō decided to execute a turn to port in sequence, he did so to preserve the sequence of his battleline, with the flagship ''Mikasa'' still in the lead (which could indicate that Admiral Tōgō wanted his more powerful units to enter action first).

Turning in sequence meant that each ship would turn one after the other whilst still following the ship in front. Effectively each ship would turn over the same piece of sea (this being the danger in the maneuver as it gives the enemy fleet the opportunity to target that area). Tōgō could have ordered his ships to turn &quot;together&quot;, that is, each ship would have made the turn at the same time and reversed course. This manoeuvre, the same effected by the French-Spanish fleet in [[Battle of Trafalgar|Trafalgar]], would be quicker but would have disrupted the sequence of the battleline and caused confusion by altering the battle plans and placing the cruisers in the lead. This was something Tōgō wished to avoid.

[[File:Japanese Fleet Proceeding Toward The Baltic Fleet.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Departure of the Combined Fleet]]

===First contact===
Because the Russians desired to slip undetected into [[Vladivostok]], as they approached Japanese waters they steered outside regular shipping channels to reduce the chance of detection. On the night of 26/27 May, the Russian fleet approached [[Tsushima Strait]].

In the misty night, a thick fog blanketed the straits, giving the Russians an advantage. At 2:45 AM [[Japan Standard Time|JST]], the Japanese [[auxiliary cruiser]] ''[[Shinano Maru (1904)|Shinano Maru]]'' observed three lights on what appeared to be a vessel in the distant horizon and closed in to investigate. These were lights of the Russian hospital ship ''Oryol'', who in compliance with the [[rules of war]], had continued to burn them.&lt;ref&gt;Watts p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; At 4:30 AM, ''Shinano Maru'' approached the vessel, noting that the vessel carried no guns and appeared to be an auxiliary. The ''Oryol'' mistook the ''Shinano Maru'' for another Russian vessel and did not attempt to notify the fleet. Instead, she signaled to inform the Japanese ship that there were other Russian vessels nearby. The ''Shinano Maru'' then sighted the shapes of ten other Russian vessels in the mist. The Russian fleet had been discovered, and any chance of reaching Vladivostok undetected had disappeared.

Wireless telegraphy played an important role from the start. At 4:55am, Captain Narukawa of the ''Shinano Maru'' sent a wireless message to Admiral Tōgō in [[Masampo]] that &quot;Enemy is in square 203&quot;. By 5 AM, intercepted wireless signals informed the Russians that they had been discovered and that Japanese scouting cruisers were shadowing them. Admiral Tōgō received his message at 5:05 AM, and immediately began to prepare his battle fleet for a sortie.

===Beginning of the battle===
[[File:Zulu flag.svg|thumb|Z flag]]
At 6.34 AM, before departing with the [[Combined Fleet]], Admiral Tōgō wired a confident message to the navy minister in [[Tokyo]]:
{{bquote|I have just received news [via wireless] that the enemy fleet has been sighted. Our fleet will proceed forthwith to sea to attack the enemy and destroy him. Today's weather is fine but waves are high.&lt;ref&gt;Koenig, William, ''Epic Sea Battles'', p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
At the same time the entire Japanese fleet put to sea, with Admiral Tōgō from his flagship ''[[Japanese battleship Mikasa|Mikasa]]'' leading over forty vessels to meet the Russians. Meanwhile, the shadowing Japanese scouting vessels sent wireless reports every few minutes as to the formation and course of the Russian fleet. There was mist which reduced visibility and the weather was poor. Wireless gave the Japanese an advantage; in his report on the battle, Admiral Tōgō noted the following:
{{bquote|Though a heavy fog covered the sea, making it impossible to observe anything at a distance of over five miles, [through wireless messaging] all the conditions of the enemy were as clear to us, who were 30 or 40 miles distant, as though they had been under our very eyes.&lt;ref&gt;Admiral Togo’s report on the Battle of Tsushima, as published by the Japanese Imperial Naval Headquarters Staff, Sept. 1905; http://www.russojapanesewar.com/togo-aar3.html&lt;/ref&gt;}}

At around 1:40 PM, both fleets sighted each other and prepared to engage. Also at 1:55 PM, Admiral Tōgō ordered the hoisting of the [[International maritime signal flags|Z flag]]:
{{bquote|The Empire's fate depends on the result of this battle, let every man do his utmost duty.&lt;ref&gt;Koenig, ''Epic Sea Battles'', p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

At 2:45 PM, Tōgō  [[Crossing the T|crossed the Russian 'T']]&lt;ref&gt;Semenoff (1907) p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; enabling him to fire broadsides, while the Russians could only reply with their forward turrets.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Mahan p. 457, 458&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Regan; ''The Guiness Book of Decisive Battles-The Battle of Tsushima 1905'', pp.176-177&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Regan, p.177&quot;&gt;Regan; ''The Guiness Book of Decisive Battles-The Battle of Tsushima 1905'', p.177&lt;/ref&gt;

===Daylight battle===

[[File:Battle of Tsushima (Chart 10) J.PNG|thumb|200px|right|The Russian ships fleeing]]
The Russians sailed from south-southwest to north-northeast; the Japanese fleet from west to northeast &quot;continuing to a point of intersection which allowed only their bow guns to bear; enabling him to throw most of the Russian batteries successively out of bearing.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mahan p. 458&quot;&gt;Mahan p. 458&lt;/ref&gt; Admiral Tōgō ordered the fleet to turn in sequence, which enabled his ships to take the same course as the Russians, though risking each battleship in turn. This U-turn was successful.  Rozhestvensky had only two alternatives, &quot;a charge direct, in line abreast&quot;, or to commence &quot;a formal pitched battle.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mahan p. 458&quot;/&gt;  He chose the latter, and at 1408 hours (2:08 PM), the Japanese flagship ''[[Japanese battleship Mikasa|Mikasa]]'' was hit at about 7,000 metres, with the Japanese replying at 6,400 metres. Superior Japanese gunnery then took its toll&lt;ref&gt;Sondhaus, Lawrence, ''Naval Warfare, 1815-1914'', P.191&lt;/ref&gt; with most of the Russian battleships being crippled. As naval engagements traditionally began at a considerably closer range, Tōgō immediately gained the advantage of surprise.

Commander Vladimir Semenoff, a Russian staff officer aboard the flagship ''Suvorov'', noted that &quot;It seemed impossible even to count the number of projectiles striking us. Shells seemed to be pouring upon us incessantly one after another.&lt;ref&gt;Semenoff (1907) p. 62, 63&lt;/ref&gt; The steel plates and superstructure on the upper decks were torn to pieces, and the splinters caused many casualties. Iron ladders were crumpled up into rings, and guns were literally hurled from their mountings. In addition to this, there was the unusually high temperature and liquid flame of the explosion, which seemed to spread over everything. I actually watched a steel plate catch fire from a burst.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Regan, p.177&quot;/&gt;

A direct hit on the ''Borodino'''s magazines by the Japanese battleship ''Fuji'' caused her to explode, which sent smoke thousands of feet into the air and trapped all of her crew on board as the ''Borodino'' slid under the sea.&lt;ref name=&quot;Regan, p.177&quot;/&gt; The Japanese ships suffered only light damage. Admiral Rozhestvensky was knocked out of action by a shell fragment that struck his skull. In the evening, [[Nikolai Nebogatov|Rear Admiral Nebogatov]] took over command of the Russian fleet. The Russians lost the [[battleship]]s ''[[Russian battleship Knyaz Suvorov|Knyaz Suvorov]]'', ''[[Russian battleship Oslyabya|Oslyabya]]'', ''[[Russian battleship Imperator Aleksander III (1901)|Imperator Aleksander III]]'' and ''[[Russian battleship Borodino|Borodino]]''.

===Night attacks===

At night, around 8 PM, 37 Japanese [[torpedo boat]]s and 21 [[destroyer]]s were thrown against the Russians. The destroyers attacked from the vanguard while the torpedo boats attacked from the east and south of the Russian fleet. The Japanese were aggressive, continuing their attacks for three hours without intermission, and as a result during the night there were a number of collisions between the small craft and Russian warships. The Russians were now dispersed in small groups trying to break northwards. By 11 PM, it appeared that the Russians had vanished, but they revealed their positions to their pursuers by turning on their searchlights — ironically, the searchlights had been turned on to spot the attackers. The old battleship ''[[Russian battleship Navarin (1891)|Navarin]]'' struck a mine and was compelled to stop, and consequently was torpedoed four times and sunk. Out of a crew of 622, only three survived to be rescued by the Japanese.

The battleship ''[[Russian battleship Sissoi Veliky (1894)|Sisoy Veliki]]'' was heavily damaged by a torpedo in the stern, and was scuttled the next day. Two old [[armoured cruiser]]s — ''[[Russian armoured cruiser Admiral Nakhimov|Admiral Nakhimov]]'' and ''[[Russian armoured cruiser Vladimir Monomakh|Vladimir Monomakh]]'' — were heavily damaged, the former by a torpedo hit to the bow, and the latter by colliding with a Japanese destroyer. They were both [[scuttling|scuttled]] by their crews the next morning, the ''Admiral Nakhimoff'' off [[Tsushima Island]], where she headed while taking on water. The night attacks had put a great strain on the Russians, as they had lost two battleships and two armoured cruisers, while the Japanese only lost three torpedo boats.

===''XGE'' signal and Russian surrender===
During the night action, Admiral Tōgō was able to rest his main fleet of armoured ships. At 9:30 AM on 27 May, what remained of the Russian fleet was sighted heading northwards. Admiral Tōgō's battleships proceeded to surround Nebogatov's remaining squadron south of the island of [[Takeshima]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Regan, p.177&quot;/&gt; At 10:34 AM, realising that his situation was hopeless, Admiral Nebogatov ordered the six ships remaining under his command to surrender. ''XGE'', an international signal of surrender, was hoisted; at 10:53 AM the Japanese agreed to accept the surrender. Realising the battle had become futile, Nebogatov was unwilling to sacrifice the lives of his sailors simply to save his own honour.&lt;ref name=&quot;Regan, p.177&quot;/&gt; He decided instead to accept the shame of surrender, knowing full well he might be shot when he returned to Russia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Regan, p.177&quot;/&gt; He said to his men:
{{bquote|You are young, and it is you who will one day retrieve the honour and glory of the Russian Navy. The lives of the two thousand four hundred men in these ships are more important than mine.&lt;ref name=&quot;Regan, p.177&quot;/&gt;}}

The wounded Admiral Rozhestvensky was a prisoner in a Japanese hospital. The victorious Admiral Tōgō would later visit him, comforting him with kind words:
{{bquote|Defeat is a common fate of a soldier. There is nothing to be ashamed of in it. The great point is whether we have performed our duty.&lt;ref name=&quot;Regan, p.178&quot;/&gt;}}

Neither Nebogatov nor Rozhestvensky were shot when they returned home to Russia. However, both were placed on trial. Rozhestvensky claimed full responsibility for the fiasco; as he had been wounded and unconscious during the last part of the battle, the Tsar commuted his death sentence. Nebogatov, having actually surrendered the fleet at the end of the naval engagement, was imprisoned for several years and eventually pardoned by the Tsar. Both men's reputations were ruined.

Until the evening of 28 May, single Russian ships were pursued by the Japanese until almost all were destroyed or captured. Three Russian warships reached Vladivostok. The cruiser ''Izumrud'', which escaped from the Japanese despite being included in Nebogatov's surrender, was scuttled by her crew after running aground near the Siberian coast. Some ships returned to Russia or were interned in neutral ports.

==Contributing factors==

The Japanese fleets had practised gunnery regularly since the beginning of the war, using [[sub-caliber round|sub-calibre]] adapters for their cannon. The Japanese had experienced gunners. Furthermore, the Japanese used mostly high-explosive shells with ''[[shimose powder|shimose]]'' ([[melinite]]), which was designed to explode on contact and wreck the upper structures of ships.&lt;ref&gt;Semenoff (1907) p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; The Russians used armour-piercing rounds with small guncotton bursting charges and unreliable fuses.&lt;ref&gt;Semenoff (1907) p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese hits caused more damage to Russian ships relative to Russian hits on Japanese ships, setting the superstructures, the paintwork and the large quantities of [[coal]] stored on the decks on fire. (The Russian fleet often bought low-quality coal at sea from merchant vessels on most of their long voyage due to the lack of friendly fuelling ports).

Japanese fire was also more accurate because they were using the latest issued (1903) [[Barr &amp; Stroud]] FA3 [[coincidence rangefinder]], which had a range of {{convert|6000|yd}}, while the Russian battleships were equipped with Liuzhol [[rangefinder]]s from the 1880s, which only had a range of about {{convert|4000|yd}}.&lt;ref&gt;Forczyk p. 56, 57&lt;/ref&gt;  And finally, by 27 May 1905, Admiral Tōgō and his men had two battleship fleet actions under their belts, which amounted to over 4 hours of [[combat]] [[experience]] in battleship to battleship combat at [[Battle of Port Arthur|Port Arthur]] and the [[Battle of the Yellow Sea|Yellow Sea]]&lt;ref&gt;Forczyk p. 43 &amp; 73&lt;/ref&gt;—experience which would eliminate the miscalculations and rash decisions made during those battles, while applying the learned lessons from those sea engagements with both [[finesse]] and ruthlessness at ''Tsushima''.&lt;ref&gt;Forczyk p. 22 &amp; 77&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russian losses===
The battle was a devastating loss for Russia, which lost all of its battleships, most of its cruisers and destroyers, and effectively ended the Russo-Japanese war in Japan's favor.  The Russians suffered 4,380 killed and 5,917 captured, including two admirals, with 1,862 interned.&lt;ref name=&quot;Regan, p.178&quot;&gt;Regan; ''The Guiness Book of Decisive Battles-The Battle of Tsushima 1905'', p.178&lt;/ref&gt;

;Battleships
The Russians lost all eight battleships and all three of their smaller coastal battleships in the battle, either sunk or captured by the Japanese, or scuttled by their crews to prevent capture. Four ships were lost to enemy action during the daylight battle on 27 May: ''[[Russian battleship Knyaz Suvorov|Knyaz Suvorov]]'', ''[[Russian battleship Imperator Aleksander III (1901)|Imperator Aleksander III]]'', ''[[Russian battleship Borodino|Borodino]]'' and the ''[[Russian battleship Oslyabya|Oslyabya]]''. The ''[[Russian battleship Navarin (1891)|Navarin]]'' was lost during the night action, on 27–28 May, while the ''[[Russian battleship Sissoi Veliky (1894)|Sissoi Veliky]]'', ''[[Russian armoured cruiser Admiral Nakhimov|Admiral Nakhimov]]'' and ''[[Russian battleship Admiral Ushakov|Admiral Ushakov]]'' were either scuttled or sunk the next day. Four other battleships under Rear Admiral Nebogatov were forced to surrender and would end up as [[prize of war|prizes of war]]. This group consisted of only one modern battleship, ''[[Russian battleship Orel|Oryol]]'', along with the old battleship ''[[Japanese battleship Iki|Imperator Nikolai I]]'' and the two small [[Coastal defence ship|coastal battleships]] ''[[Japanese battleship Okinoshima|General-Admiral Graf Apraksin]]'' and ''[[Japanese battleship Mishima|Admiral Senyavin]]''. The small coastal battleship ''[[Russian battleship Admiral Ushakov|Admiral Ushakov]]'' refused to surrender and was scuttled by her crew.

;Cruisers
The Russian Navy lost four of its eight cruisers during the battle, three were interned by the Americans, with just one reaching Vladivostok. The ''[[Russian armoured cruiser Vladimir Monomakh|Vladimir Monomakh]]'' and ''[[Russian cruiser Svetlana (1896)|Svetlana]]'' were sunk the next day, after the daylight battle. The cruiser ''[[Russian armoured cruiser Dmitrii Donskoi|Dmitri Donskoy]]'' fought against six Japanese cruisers and survived; however, due to heavy damage she was scuttled. The ''[[Russian cruiser Izumrud|Izumrud]]'' ran aground near the Siberian coast. Three Russian [[protected cruiser]]s, ''[[Russian cruiser Aurora|Aurora]]'', ''[[Russian cruiser Zhemchug|Zhemchug]]'', and ''[[Russian cruiser Oleg|Oleg]]'' escaped to the [[United States Navy|US Naval]] base at [[Manila]] in what was then American-controlled [[Philippines]], where they were interned. The armed yacht classified as a cruiser, ''[[Russian cruiser Almaz|Almaz]]'', alone was able to reach [[Vladivostok]].

;Destroyers and Auxiliaries
Imperial Russia lost six of its nine destroyers in the battle, had one interned by the Chinese, with two escaping to Vladivostok. Five destroyers—the ''Buiny'', ''Buistry'', ''Bezupreshchny'', ''Gromky'' and ''Blestyashchy''—were sunk on 28 May, and the ''Byedovy'' surrendered that day. ''Bodry'' was interned in [[Shanghai]]. The ''Grosny'' and ''Bravy'' reached [[Vladivostok]].

Of the auxiliaries, the ''Kamchatka'', ''Ural'' and ''Rus'' were sunk on 27 May, ''Irtuish'' ran aground on 28 May, ''Koreya'' and ''Svir'' were interned in [[Shanghai]] and the ''Anadyr'' escaped to [[Madagascar]]. The [[hospital ship]]s ''Oryol'' and ''Kostroma'' were captured, with the ''Kostroma'' released afterwards.

===Japanese losses===
The Japanese lost only three torpedo boats (Nos. ''34'', ''35'' and ''69''), with 117 killed men and 500 wounded.&lt;ref name=&quot;Regan, p.178&quot;/&gt;

===Political consequences===
Imperial Russia's prestige was badly damaged and the defeat was a severe blow to the [[House of Romanov|Romanov dynasty]]. Nearly the entire Russian fleet was lost in a single battle; the fast armed yacht ''Almaz'' (classified as a cruiser of the 2nd rank) and the destroyers ''Grozny'' and ''Bravy'' were the only Russian ships to make it through to [[Vladivostok]]. In ''[[The Guns of August]]'', [[Barbara Tuchman]] argued that Russia's loss destabilized the balance of power in Europe, emboldening the [[Central Powers]] and contributing to [[World War I|their decision to go to war in 1914]].

The battle had a profound cultural and political impact upon Japan. It was the first defeat of a European power by an Asian nation,&lt;ref&gt;Forczyk back cover&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pleshakov p. XVI&lt;/ref&gt; using the full breadth of then-modern industrial technology. It also weakened the notion of white superiority, widely accepted in Western society before that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=the Impact of the Russo-Japanese War in Asia | url=http://www.globaled.org/vietnamandcambodia/lessons/russojapanesewar.php | publisher=The American Forum for Global Education | accessdate=2010-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The victory established Japan as the sixth greatest naval power&lt;ref name=&quot;Sondhaus p.192&quot;&gt;Sondhaus, Lawrence, ''Naval Warfare, 1815-1914,'' P.192&lt;/ref&gt; while the Russian navy declined to one barely stronger than that of [[Austria-Hungary]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Sondhaus p.192&quot;/&gt;

In ''The Guiness Book of Decisive Battles'', [[Geoffrey Regan]] argues that the victory bolstered Japan's increasingly aggressive political and military establishment. According to Regan, the lopsided Japanese victory at Tsushima:&lt;blockquote&gt;...created a legend that was to haunt Japan's leaders for forty years. A British admiral once said, 'It takes three years to build a ship, but 300 years to build a tradition.' Japan thought that the victory had completed this task in a matter of a few years ... It had all been too easy. Looking at Tōgō's victory over one of the world's great powers convinced some Japanese military men that with more ships, and bigger and better ones, similar victories could be won throughout the Pacific. Perhaps no power could resist the Japanese navy, not even Britain and the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;Regan, p.178&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Regan believes the victory contributed to the Japanese road to later disaster, &quot;because the result was so misleading. Certainly the Japanese navy had performed well, but its opponents had been weak, and it was not invincible... Tōgō's victory [helped] set Japan on a path that would eventually lead her&quot; to the Second World War.&lt;ref name=&quot;Regan, p.178&quot;/&gt;

===Dreadnought arms race===
{{Main|Dreadnought}}
Britain's [[First Sea Lord]] [[Admiral Fisher]] argued the Japanese victory at Tsushima confirmed the importance of large guns and speed on modern battleships,&lt;ref&gt;Massie, p. 471, 474, 480&lt;/ref&gt; and in October 1905 the British began construction of [[HMS Dreadnought (1906)|HMS ''Dreadnought'']], which upon her launching in 1906 began a dreadnought naval arms race between Britain and Germany in the years before 1914. The British and German fleets met in only one major action in [[World War I]], the indecisive [[Battle of Jutland]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Rivalry of [[Germany]] and [[England]]'', Edward Raymond Turner, The Sewanee Review, Vol. 21, No. 2  (Apr., 1913), pp. 129-147&lt;/ref&gt;

The Abenaki are one of the five members of the [[Wabanaki Confederacy]]. &quot;Abenaki&quot; is a linguistic and geographic grouping; historically there was not a strong central authority, but as listed below a large number of smaller bands and tribes who shared many cultural traits.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sultzman&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://tolatsga.org/aben.html| author=Lee Sultzman| title=Abenaki History| date=July 21, 1997| accessdate=March 20, 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100411025556/http://www.tolatsga.org/aben.html| archivedate= 11 April 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Retrieved August 14, 2012 from HighBeam Research: http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G2-3048800002.html&lt;/ref&gt; The Abenaki people call themselves '''''Alnôbak''''', meaning &quot;Real People&quot; (c.f., [[Lenape language]]: ''[[Lenape]]k''). They also use the [[Endonym|autonym]] '''''Alnanbal''''', meaning &quot;men&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sultzman&quot;/&gt;  In addition, when compared to the more interior [[Algonquian peoples]], they call themselves '''''Wôbanuok''''', meaning &quot;Easterners&quot; (c.f.

==Subdivisions==
Historically, ethnologists have classified the Abenaki as groups: [[Western Abenaki]] and [[Eastern Abenaki]].  Within these groups are the Abenaki bands:{{col-begin}}{{col-2}}

Due to erroneous use of the word ''Abenaki'' to mean ''Wabanaki,''  all the Abenaki together with the [[Penobscot people]] are often described as &quot;Western 'Wabenaki'&quot; peoples, while the [[Mi'kmaq people|Mi'kmaq]], [[Maliseet]] and [[Passamaquoddy]] are described as &quot;Eastern 'Wabenaki'&quot; peoples.

==Location==
[[File:Wabanaki wigwam with birch bark covering.jpg|thumb|left|Abenaki [[wigwam]] with [[birch]] bark covering]]
The homeland of the Abenaki, which they call ''Ndakinna'' (our land), extended across most of northern [[New England]], southern [[Quebec]], and the southern [[Canadian Maritimes]]. The Eastern Abenaki population was concentrated in portions of [[Maine]] east of [[New Hampshire]]'s [[White Mountains (New Hampshire)|White Mountains]]. The other major tribe, the Western Abenaki, lived in the [[Connecticut River]] valley in Vermont, New Hampshire and Massachusetts.&lt;ref&gt;Waldman, Carl. ''Encyclopedia of Native American Tribes: Third Edition'' (New York: Checkmark Books, 2006) p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;  The Missiquoi lived along the eastern shore of [[Lake Champlain]].  The [[Pennacook]] lived along the [[Merrimack River]] in southern New Hampshire. The maritime Abenaki lived around the [[Saint Croix River (Maine – New Brunswick)|St. Croix]] and [[Saint John River (Bay of Fundy)|Wolastoq (St. John River)]] valleys near the boundary line between Maine and [[New Brunswick]].

The English settlement of New England and frequent wars forced many Abenaki to retreat to [[Quebec]]. The Abenaki settled in the [[Sillery, Quebec City|Sillery]] region of Quebec between 1676 and 1680, and subsequently, for about twenty years, lived on the banks of the [[Chaudière River]] near the falls, before settling in [[Odanak, Quebec|Odanak]] and [[Wôlinak, Quebec|Wôlinak]] in the early eighteenth century. The name &quot;Abenaki&quot; was derived from the terms ''w8bAn'' (light) and ''Aki'' (land), which mean &quot;people in the rising sun&quot; or &quot;people of the East&quot;.  In those days, the Abenaki practiced a [[subsistence economy]] based on hunting, fishing, trapping, berry picking and on growing corn, beans, squash, potatoes and tobacco. They also produced baskets, made of ash and sweet grass, for picking wild berries, and boiled [[maple sap]] to make syrup. Basket weaving remains a traditional activity for members of both communities.{{cn|date=May 2012}}

During the Anglo-French wars, the Abenaki were allies of France, having been displaced from Ndakinna by immigrating English people. An anecdote from this period tells the story of a warrior named [[Nescambious|Nescambuit]], who killed more than 140 enemies of [[Louis XIV of France|King Louis XIV of France]] and received the rank of knight.  Not all Abenaki natives fought on the side of the French, however; many remained on their native lands in the northern colonies.  Much of the trapping was done by the people, and traded to the English colonists for durable goods. These contributions by native American Abenaki peoples went largely unreported.{{fact|WE can't make the observation about &quot;largely unreported.&quot; A reliable source must do so|date=May 2012}}

Two tribal communities formed in Canada, one once known as [[Saint-François-du-Lac, Quebec|Saint-Francois-du-lac]] near Pierreville, Quebec (now called Odanak, Abenaki for &quot;coming home&quot;), and the other near [[Bécancour, Quebec|Bécancour]] (now known as Wôlinak) on the south shore of the [[Saint Lawrence River]], directly across the river from [[Trois-Rivières]]. These two Abenaki reserves continue to grow and develop. Since the year 2000, the total Abenaki population (on and off reserve) has doubled to 2,101 members in 2011.  Approximately 400 Abenaki reside on these two reserves, which cover a total area of less than {{convert|7|km2}}.  The unrecognized majority are off-reserve members, living in various cities and towns across Canada and the United States.

There are no Abenaki tribes listed as [[federally recognized tribes]] by the [[United States]] [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] but about 3,200 Abenaki live in Vermont and New Hampshire, without reservations, chiefly around [[Lake Champlain]]. The remaining Abenaki people live in multi-racial towns and cities across Canada and the U.S.A., mainly in Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, and northern New England.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sultzman&quot;/&gt;

Four Abenaki communities are located in Vermont. On April 22, 2011, Vermont officially recognized two Abenaki bands: the Nulhegan Band of the Coosuk-Abenaki and the Elnu Abenaki Tribe. On May 7, 2012, the Abenaki Nation at Missisquoi and the Koasek of the Koas Abenaki Traditional Band received recognition by the State of Vermont. The Nulhegan are located in the [[Northeast Kingdom]] of Vermont, with tribal headquarters in [[Brownington, Vermont|Brownington]], and the Elnu Abenaki are located in southeastern Vermont with tribal headquarters in [[Jamaica, Vermont]]. The Sokoki (the Abenaki Nation at Missisquoi) are located along the [[Missisquoi River]] (''Masipskiwibi'') in northwestern Vermont, with tribal headquarters in [[Swanton (town), Vermont|Swanton]]. Their traditional land is along the river, extending to its outlet at [[Lake Champlain]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Abenaki Nation&quot;/&gt;

==Language==
{{Main|Abenaki language}}

The Abenaki language is closely related to the [[Penobscot people|Panawahpskek (Penobscot)]] language. Other neighboring Wabanaki tribes, the [[Mi'kmaq language|Mi'kmaq]], [[Maliseet|Wolastoqiyik (Maliseet)]], and [[Passamaquoddy|Pestomuhkati (Passamaquoddy)]], and other [[Eastern Algonquian languages]] share many linguistic similarities. It has come close to extinction as a spoken language. Tribal members are working to revive the Abenaki language at Odanak (means &quot;in the village&quot;), a First Nations Abenaki reserve near [[Pierreville, Quebec]], and throughout [[New Hampshire]], [[Vermont]] and [[New York]] state.

==History==
In 1614, [[Thomas Hunt (slaver)|Thomas Hunt]] captured 24 young Abenaki people and took them to England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Bourne | first=Russell | title= The Red King's Rebellion, Racial Politics in New England 1675-1678 | year= 1990 | isbn= 0-689-12000-1 |page=214}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the European colonization of North America, the land occupied by the Abenaki was in the area between the new colonies of English in Massachusetts and the French in Quebec. Since no party agreed to territorial boundaries, there was regular conflict among them. The Abenaki were traditionally allied with the [[France|French]]; during the reign of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], Chief [[Nescambious|Assacumbuit]] was designated a member of the French nobility for his service.

[[Image:Abenakis.jpg|thumb|right|Abenaki couple, 18th-century]]
Facing annihilation from English attacks and [[epidemic]]s of new infectious diseases, the Abenaki started to emigrate to [[Quebec]] around 1669. The governor of [[New France]] allocated two [[Seigneurial system of New France|seigneuries]] (large self-administered areas similar to feudal fiefs).  The first was on the [[Saint-François River|Saint Francis River]] and is now known as the ''[[Odanak]]'' Indian Reservation; the second was founded near [[Bécancour, Quebec|Bécancour]] and is called the ''[[Wolinak]]'' Indian Reservation.

The English and French regularly raided each other's settlements with the help of Indian allies.  Some captives were adopted into the Mohawk and Abenaki tribes; older captives were generally ransomed, and the colonies carried on a brisk trade. In 1724 during [[Father Rale's War]], the English took the principal Abenaki town in Maine, [[Norridgewock]], and killed their [[Catholic]] [[missionary]], Father [[Sébastien Rale]], who had helped to instigate the war.  The following year a party of English colonists led by [[John Lovewell]], out to collect scalps to redeem for bounties offered by the [[Province of Massachusetts Bay]], came near an Abenaki village near present-day [[Fryeburg, Maine]]. Two returning Abenaki war parties engaged the English, who withdrew after a 10-hour battle.  Due to this pressure, more Abenaki emigrated to the settlement on the St. Francis River.

Because many of the Abenaki moved further north as white settlers began to occupy the seacoast and southern areas of New England, when they later attacked the English they were considered raiders invading from Canada. In truth, they were Native Americans fighting to regain their ancestral lands.{{fact|sounds like [[WP:OR]]. Instances are documented that some of these were scalp-hunters or stirred up by the French|date=July 2012}}

===Canada===
The development of tourism projects has allowed the Canadian Abenaki to develop a modern economy, while preserving their culture and traditions. For example, since 1960, the Odanak Historical Society has managed the first and one of the largest aboriginal museums in Quebec, a few miles from the Quebec-Montreal axis. Over 5,000 people visit the Abenaki Museum annually. Several Abenaki companies include: in Wôlinak, General Fiberglass Engineering employs a dozen natives, with annual sales of more than $3 million Canadian dollars. Odanak is now active in transportation and distribution.  Notable Abenaki from this area include the documentary filmmaker [[Alanis Obomsawin]] ([[National Film Board of Canada]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbodanak.com/anglais/page_/accueil_agl.htm |title=Administration |publisher=Cbodanak.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
No Abenaki group has been [[federally recognized tribe|federally recognized]] as a tribe in the United States.

====Vermont====
In 2006, the state of [[Vermont]] officially recognized the Abenaki as a People, but not a Tribe. The state noted that many Abenaki had been assimilated, and only small remnants remained on reservations during and after the [[French and Indian War]], later eugenics projects further decimated the Abenaki people of America through forced sterilization and questionable 'miscarriages' at birth.{{fact|need citation for this. quotes around anything considered pov|date=July 2012}} As noted above, facing annihilation, many Abenaki had begun emigrating to Canada, then under French control, around 1669.

The [[Sokoki-St. Francis Band]] of the Abenaki Nation organized a tribal council in 1976 at [[Swanton (town), Vermont|Swanton, Vermont]]. Vermont granted recognition of the council the same year, but later withdrew it. In 1982, the band applied for federal recognition, which is still pending.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sultzman&quot;/&gt; Four Abenaki communities are located in Vermont. On April 22, 2011, Vermont officially recognized two Abenaki bands: the Nulhegan Band of the Coosuk-Abenaki and the El Nu Abenaki Tribe. On May 7, 2012, the Abenaki Nation at Missisquoi and the Koasek of the Koas Abenaki Traditional Band received recognition by the State of Vermont.
&lt;!---this repeats information given above. Need to consolidate somewhere and not repeat it---&gt;
The Abenaki who chose to remain in the United States did not fare as well as their Canadian counterparts.  Tribal connections were lost as those Abenaki who were tolerated by the Anglo population were assimilated into colonial society.  What familial groups remained were often eradicated, in the early 20th century, through forced [[sterilization (medicine)|sterilization]] and [[pregnancy termination]] policies in Vermont.  There were over 3,400 reported cases of sterilization of Abenaki having been performed, many of which involved termination of an unborn fetus.  No documentation of informed consent for these procedures was found. Given Vermont's crusade to eliminate the &quot;true people&quot; from its population it is likely that the reported sterilizations represent only a fraction of those actually performed.{{fact|sounds [[WP:OR]]|date=July 2012}}  After this period the only Abenaki that remained in the United States were those who could pass for white, or avoid capture and subsequent dissolution of their families through forced interment in &quot;schools&quot; after their sterilization.{{cn|date=July 2012}}  At the time, many of the children who were sterilized were not even aware of what the physicians had done to them.

This was performed under the auspices of the Brandon School of the Feeble-Minded, and the Vermont Reform School. It was documented in the 1911 &quot;Preliminary Report of the Committee of the Eugenic Section of the American Breeder's Association to Study and to Report on the Best Practical Means for Cutting Off the Defective Germ-Plasm in the Human Population.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uvm.edu/~lkaelber/eugenics/VT/VT.html |title=Vermont Eugenics |publisher=Uvm.edu |date=1931-03-31 |accessdate=2012-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Henrik Palmgren |url=http://www.redicecreations.com/article.php?id=609 |title=The Horrifying American Roots of Nazi Eugenics |publisher=Redicecreations.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Minority recognition=====
The [[Vermont]] Elnu ([[Jamaica, Vermont|Jamaica]]) and Nulhegan ([[Brownington, Vermont|Brownington]]) bands' application for official recognition was recommended and referred to the [[Vermont General Assembly]] by the [[Vermont Commission on Native American Affairs]] on January 19, 2011, as a result of a process established by the Vermont legislature in 2010.  Recognition allows applicants to seek scholarship funds reserved for American Indians and to receive federal &quot;native made&quot; designation for the bands' arts and crafts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abenaki Turn to Vermont Legislature for Recognition&quot;&gt;Hallenbeck, Terri.

Retrieved January 20, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 22, 2011, Vermont officially recognized two Abenaki bands: the Nulhegan Band of the Coosuk-Abenaki and the El Nu Abenaki Tribe. On May 7, 2012, the Abenaki Nation at Missisquoi and the Koasek of the Koas Abenaki Traditional Band received recognition by the State of Vermont.

====New Hampshire and minority recognition====
In New Hampshire the Abenaki, along with other Native American groups, have proposed legislation for recognition as a minority group. This bill was debated in 2010 in the [[New Hampshire General Court|state legislature]]. The bill would create a state commission on Native American relations, which would act as an advisory group to the [[governor of New Hampshire|governor]] and the state government in general.&lt;ref name=&quot;HB 1610&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/legislation/2010/HB1610.html| title=HB 1610-FN – As Amended by the House| publisher=NH General Court| accessdate=March 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Abenaki want to gain formal state recognition as a people.

Some people have opposed the bill, as they fear it may lead to Abenaki land claims for property now owned and occupied by European Americans. Others worry that the Abenaki may use recognition as a step toward opening a casino. But, the bill specifically says that &quot;this act shall not be interpreted to provide any Native American or Abenaki person with any other special rights or privileges that the state does not confer on or grant to other state residents.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Abenaki Nation&quot;/&gt; New Hampshire has considered expanding gambling separate from the Native Americans.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gambling&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.wmur.com/money/22744578/detail.html| title=Gambling Bill Would Create 6 Casinos, Allow Black Jack| publisher=WMUR.com| date=March 4, 2010| accessdate=March 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The council would be under the Department of Cultural Resources,&lt;ref name=&quot;HB 1610&quot;/&gt; so it would be in the same department as the State Council on the Arts. The bill would allow for the creation and sale of goods to be labeled as Native-made, to create a source of income for the Natives in New Hampshire.

The numerous groups of Natives in the state have created a New Hampshire Inter-tribal Council, which holds statewide meetings and [[powwow]]s. Dedicated to preserving the culture of the Natives in New Hampshire, the group is one of the chief supporters of the HB 1610; the Abenaki, the main tribe in the state, are the only people named specifically in the bill.&lt;ref name=&quot;NHITC&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://nhitnac.tripod.com/index2.html| title=The New Hampshire Inter-Tribal Native American Council: Mission Statement| accessdate=March 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
[[File:Abenaki Tribe.jpg|thumb|left|An Abenaki in traditional clothing]]
There are a dozen variations of the name &quot;Abenaki&quot;, such as Abenaquiois, Abakivis, Quabenakionek, Wabenakies and others.

The Abenaki were described in the ''Jesuit Relations'' as not [[cannibalism|cannibals]], and as docile, ingenious, temperate in the use of liquor, and not profane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Travels and Explorations of the Jesuit Missionaries in New France, 1610—1791|editor=Reuben Gold Thwaites|publisher=The Burrows Company|year=1900|url=http://puffin.creighton.edu/jesuit/relations/relations_63.html|accessdate=2006-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All Abenaki tribes lived a lifestyle similar to the Algonquian-speaking peoples of southern New England. They cultivated crops for food, and located their villages on or near fertile river floodplains. Other less major, but still important, parts of their diet included game and fish from hunting and fishing, and wild plants.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sultzman&quot;/&gt;

They lived in scattered bands of extended families for most of the year. Each man had different hunting territories inherited through his father.  Unlike the [[Iroquois]], the Abenaki were [[patrilineal]].  Bands came together during the spring and summer at temporary villages near rivers, or somewhere along the seacoast for planting and fishing.  These villages occasionally had to be fortified, depending on the alliances and enemies of other tribes or of Europeans near the village. Abenaki villages were quite small when compared to those of the Iroquois; the average number of people was about 100.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sultzman&quot;/&gt;

Most Abenaki crafted dome-shaped, bark-covered [[wigwam]]s for housing, though a few preferred oval-shaped long houses. During the winter, the Abenaki lived in small groups further inland. The homes there were bark-covered wigwams shaped in a way similar to the [[teepee]]s of the [[Great Plains]] Indians.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sultzman&quot;/&gt;  During the winter, the Abenaki lined the inside of their conical wigwams with bear and deer skins for warmth.  The Abenaki also built long houses similar to those of the Iroquois.&lt;ref&gt;Waldman, ''Encyclopedia of Native American Tribes'' p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

The Abenaki hold on to their traditions and ways of life in several ways. The Sokoki do so in the current constitution for their government. It has a chief, a council of elders, and methods and means for election to the council and chieftainship, as well as requirements for citizenship in the tribe.&lt;ref name=&quot;constitution&quot;&gt;Constitution of the Sovereign Republic of the Abenaki Nation of Missisquoi&lt;/ref&gt; They also list many of the different traditions they uphold, such as the different dances they perform and what those dances mean.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abenaki Nation&quot;/&gt; During several of these dances there is no photography allowed, out of respect for the culture. For several, there are instructions such as &quot;All stand while it is sung&quot; or &quot;All Stand to Show Respect.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Abenaki Nation&quot;/&gt;

===Hair style and other marriage traditions===
[[File:Abenaki Braid.gif|thumb|Modernized traditional spiritual hairstyle for a married Abenaki man]]
Traditionally, Abenaki men kept their hair long and loose. When a man would find a girlfriend, he would tie his hair.  When he married, he would attach the hair of the scalp with a piece of leather and shave all but the ponytail. The modernized spiritual version has the man with a girlfriend tying his hair and braiding it. When he marries, he keeps all his hair in a braid, shaving only the side and back of the head. The spiritual meaning surrounding this cut is most importantly to indicate betrothal or fidelity as a married Abenaki man. In much the same way as the Christian marriage tradition, there is an (optional) exchange and blessing of wedding rings.  These rings are the outward and visible sign of the unity of this couple.&lt;ref&gt;''The Encyclopedia of Native American Costume''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Cowasuck Band of the Pennacook Abenaki People&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Verbal teachings (Oral Traditions) from the late &quot;Berth Daigle&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|date=October 2010|reason=&lt;nowiki&gt;This is not a proper reference citation. Use [[Template:Cite web]] or similar to provide source details. Use &lt;ref...&gt; inline in the article (see [[WP:CITE]]) to source the specific facts provided by this reference.&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}

Changes in the hair style were symbolic of a complex courtship process. The man would give the woman a box made of a fine wood, which was decorated with the virtues of the woman; the woman would give a similar box to the man. Everyone in the tribe must agree to the marriage. They erect a pole planted in the earth, and if anyone disagrees, he strikes the pole. The disagreement must be resolved or the marriage does not happen.&lt;ref name=&quot;marriage&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.cowasuck.org/lifestyle/wedding.cfm| title=Marriage or Wedding Ceremony| publisher=Cowasuck Band of the Pennacook-Abenaki People| accessdate=March 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gender, food, division of labor, and other cultural traits===
The Abenaki were a farming society that supplemented agriculture with hunting and gathering. Generally the men were the hunters. The women tended the fields and grew the crops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Food&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.cowasuck.org/lifestyle/food.cfm| title=What We Ate| publisher=Cowasuck Band of the Pennacook-Abenaki People| accessdate=March 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their fields, they planted the crops in groups of &quot;sisters&quot;. The three sisters were grown together: the stalk of corn supported the beans, and squash or pumpkins provided ground cover and reduced weeds.&lt;ref name=&quot;Food&quot;/&gt;

The Abenaki were a patrilineal society, which was common among New England tribes. In this they differed from the six Iroquois tribes to the west in New York, and from many other North American Indian tribes who had [[matrilineal]] societies. In those systems, women controlled property and hereditary leadership was passed through the women's line.  Children born to a married couple belonged to the mother's clan, and her eldest brother was an important mentor, especially for boys. The biological father had a lesser role.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sultzman&quot;/&gt;

Group decision-making was done by a [[consensus]] method. The idea is that every group (family, band, tribe, etc.) must have equal say, so each group would elect a spokesperson. Each smaller group would send the decision of the group to an impartial facilitator. If there was a disagreement, the facilitator would tell the groups to discuss again. In addition to the debates, there was a goal of total understanding for all members. If there was not total understanding, the debate would stop until there was understanding.

When the tribal members debate issues, they consider the Three Truths:
#Peace: Is this preserved?
#Righteousness: Is it moral?
#Power: Does it preserve the integrity of the group?

These truths guide all group deliberations, and the goal is to reach a consensus. If there is no consensus for change, they agree to keep the [[status quo]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Consent&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.cowasuck.org/lifestyle/consent2.cfm| title=The Consensual Decision-Making Process| publisher=Cowasuck Band of the Pennacook-Abenaki People| accessdate=March 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Storytelling===
[[Storytelling]] is a major part of Abenaki culture. It is used not only as entertainment but also as a teaching method. The Abenaki view stories as having lives of their own and being aware of how they are used. Stories were used as a means of teaching children behavior. Children were not to be mistreated, and so instead of punishing the child, they would be told a story.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stories&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://abenakination.org/stories.html| title=The Abenaki Perspective on Storytelling| author=Joe Bruchac| publisher=Abenaki Nation| accessdate=March 22, 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100210183130/http://www.abenakination.org/stories.html| archivedate= 10 February 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the stories is of Azban the Raccoon. This is a story about a proud [[raccoon]] that challenges a [[waterfall]] to a shouting contest. When the waterfall does not respond, Azban dives into the waterfall to try to outshout it; he is swept away because of his [[pride]]. This story would be used to show a child the pitfalls of pride.&lt;ref name=&quot;Azban&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://abenakination.org/azban.html| title=Raccoon and the Waterfall| publisher=Abenaki Nation| accessdate=March 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mythology===

==Population and epidemics==
Before the Abenaki — except the Pennacook and Mi'kmaq — had contact with the European world, their population may have numbered as many as 40,000. Around 20,000 would have been Eastern Abenaki, another 10,000 would have been Western Abenaki, and the last 10,000 would have been Maritime Abenaki. Early contacts with European fishermen resulted in two major epidemics that affected Abenaki during the 16th century. The first epidemic was an unknown sickness occurring sometime between 1564 and 1570, and the second one was [[typhus]] in 1586. Multiple epidemics arrived a decade prior to the English settlement of Massachusetts in 1620, when three separate sicknesses swept across New England and the Canadian Maritimes. Maine was hit very hard during the year of 1617, with a fatality rate of 75%, and the population of the Eastern Abenaki fell to about 5,000. The more isolated Western Abenaki suffered fewer fatalities, losing about half of their original population of 10,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sultzman&quot;/&gt;

The new diseases continued to strike in epidemics, starting with [[smallpox]] in 1631, 1633, and 1639. Seven years later, an unknown epidemic struck, with [[influenza]] passing through the following year. Smallpox affected the Abenaki again in 1649, and [[diphtheria]] came through 10 years later. Smallpox struck in 1670, and influenza in 1675. Smallpox affected the Native Americans in 1677, 1679, 1687, along with [[measles]], 1691, 1729, 1733, 1755, and finally in 1758.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sultzman&quot;/&gt;

The Abenaki population continued to decline, but in 1676, they took in thousands of refugees from many southern New England tribes displaced by settlement and [[King Philip's War]]. Because of this, descendants of nearly every southern New England Algonquian tribe can be found among the Abenaki people. A century later, fewer than 1,000 Abenaki remained after the [[American Revolution]].

In the 1990 U.S. Census, 1,549 people identified themselves as Abenaki. So did 2,544 people in the 2000 U.S census, with 6,012 people claiming Abenaki heritage.&lt;ref name=UXL /&gt; In 1991 Canadian Abenaki numbered 945; by 2006 they numbered 2,164.&lt;ref name=UXL /&gt;

==Fiction==
[[Lydia Maria Child]] wrote of the Abenaki in her short story, &quot;The Church in the Wilderness&quot; (1828).  Several Abenaki characters and much about their 18th-century culture are featured in the [[Kenneth Roberts (author)|Kenneth Roberts]] novel ''Arundel'' (1930).   The film ''[[Northwest Passage (film)|Northwest Passage]]'' (1940) is based on a novel of the same name by Roberts.

The Abenaki are featured in [[Charles McCarry]]'s historical novel ''Bride of the Wilderness'' (1988), and [[James Archibald Houston]]'s novel ''Ghost Fox'' (1977), both of which are set in the eighteenth century; and in [[Jodi Picoult]]'s ''Second Glance'' (2003) and ''Lone Wolf'' (2012) novels, set in the contemporary world.  Books for younger readers both have historical settings: [[Joseph Bruchac]]'s ''The Arrow Over the Door'' (1998) (grades 4-6) is set in 1777; and Beth Kanell's young adult novel, ''The Darkness Under the Water'' (2008), concerns a young Abenaki-French Canadian girl during the time of the [[Vermont Eugenics Project]], 1931-1936.

==Non-fiction==
Accounts of life with the Abenaki can be found in the [[captivity narratives]] written by women taken captive by the Abenaki from the early New England settlements: [[Hannah Duston]] (1702); [[Elizabeth Hanson (captive of Native Americans)|Elizabeth Hanson]] (1728); [[Susannah Willard Johnson]] (1754); and [[Jemima Howe]] (1792).&lt;ref&gt;''Women's Indian Captivity Narratives'', ed.

'''Bauhaus''' were an English [[rock music|rock]] band formed in [[Northampton]] in 1978. The group consisted of [[Peter Murphy (musician)|Peter Murphy]] (vocals), [[Daniel Ash]] (guitar), [[Kevin Haskins]] (drums), and [[David J]] (bass guitar). The band was originally '''Bauhaus 1919''' before they dropped the numerical portion within a year of formation. With their dark and gloomy sound and image, Bauhaus are generally considered the first [[gothic rock]] group.

Bauhaus first broke up in 1983. Peter Murphy began a solo career while the other members continued as [[Tones on Tail]] and, later, [[Love and Rockets (band)|Love and Rockets]]. Both enjoyed greater commercial success in the United States than Bauhaus had, but disappeared from the charts in their homeland. The band reunited for a 1998 tour and on a more permanent basis in 2005. The group announced plans to disband again following the release of their final album, ''[[Go Away White]]'', in 2008.

== History ==

Daniel Ash, his friend David J. Haskins, and Haskins' younger brother Kevin had played together in various bands since childhood. One of the longer-lived of these was a band called The Craze, which performed a few times around Northampton in 1978. However, The Craze still split up fairly quickly, and Ash once again tried to convince his old school friend Peter Murphy to join him, simply because Ash thought he had the right look for a band.&lt;ref&gt;Shirley, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; Murphy, who was working in a printing factory, decided to give it a try, despite never having written any lyrics or music. During their first rehearsal, he co-wrote the song &quot;In the Flat Field&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;  Ash's old bandmate Kevin Haskins joined as the drummer. Ash made a point of not inviting David J, the driving force in their previous bands, because he wanted a band he could control.&lt;ref&gt;Shirley, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; After only a few weeks though, Ash reconsidered and invited Haskins to replace original bassist Chris Barber. Haskins had already agreed to tour American airbases with another band, but decided that joining his friends' group was &quot;the right thing to do&quot;. With their line-up complete, the unnamed band played their first gig at the Cromwell pub in Wellingborough on New Year's Eve 1978.&lt;ref&gt;Shirley, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

The band chose the name Bauhaus 1919, a reference to the German [[Bauhaus]] art movement of the 1920s, because of its &quot;stylistic implications and associations&quot;, according to David J.&lt;ref&gt;Shirley, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; The band also chose to use the same [[typeface]] used on the Bauhaus college building in [[Dessau]], [[Germany]]. Bauhaus associate Graham Bentley said that the group was unlike any Northampton band of the time, most of which played predominantly [[cover songs]].&lt;ref&gt;Shirley, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; Bentley videotaped a performance by the group, which was sent to several record labels in the hope of obtaining a contract. This approach was hindered partly because many record companies at the time did not have home video equipment or Bentley had to provide it himself, so the group decided to record a demo.&lt;ref&gt;Shirley, pp.&amp;nbsp;23–24&lt;/ref&gt;

=== &quot;Bela Lugosi's Dead&quot; and 4AD ===
Together for only six weeks, Bauhaus entered the studio for the first time at Beck Studios in [[Wellingborough]] to record a demo.&lt;ref&gt;Shirley, pp.&amp;nbsp;25–26&lt;/ref&gt; The band recorded five songs; one of the tracks from the session, &quot;[[Bela Lugosi's Dead]]&quot;, running more than nine minutes, was released as the group's debut single in August 1979 on [[Small Wonder Records]] as Bauhaus (the 1919 abandoned).&lt;ref&gt;Shirley, pp.&amp;nbsp;28–29&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; The single received a positive review in ''Sounds'' and stayed on the British independent charts for two years. The song received crucial airplay on [[BBC Radio 1]] and DJ [[John Peel]]'s evening show, and Bauhaus was subsequently asked to record a session for Peel's show, which was broadcast on January 3, 1980.&lt;ref&gt;Shirley, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

The band released three more singles, &quot;[[Dark Entries]]&quot;, &quot;[[Terror Couple Kill Colonel]]&quot; and &quot;[[Telegram Sam]]&quot; — originally written by [[glam rock]] pioneers [[T. Rex (band)|T. Rex]] — before the debut of their first album ''[[In the Flat Field]]'' in 1980 on [[4AD]]. ''[[NME]]''  described it as &quot;Gothick-Romantick pseudo-decadence&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Gill |first=Andy |title=Gothick as a brick [''In the Flat Field'' review] |journal=[[NME]] |pages=p32 |date=8 November 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite negative reviews, ''In the Flat Field'' topped the indie charts and made headway onto the British pop charts, peaking for one week at number 72.&lt;ref&gt;Shirley, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Beggars Banquet and breakup ===

Bauhaus' growing success outstripped 4AD's resources, so the band moved to 4AD's parent label [[Beggars Banquet Records]].&lt;ref&gt;Shirley, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; Bauhaus released &quot;[[Kick in the Eye]]&quot; as its debut release on the label. The single reached number 59 on the charts.&lt;ref&gt;Shirley, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; the following single &quot;[[The Passion of Lovers]]&quot; peaked at number 56.&lt;ref&gt;Shirley, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; Bauhaus released its second album, ''[[Mask (Bauhaus album)|Mask]]'', in October 1981. The band employed more keyboards and a variety of other instruments to add to the diversity of the record. In an unconventional move, the group shot a video for the album's title track as a promotional tool for the band as a whole and not any specific song from the record.&lt;ref&gt;Shirley, pp.&amp;nbsp;63–64&lt;/ref&gt;

Bauhaus followed with the single &quot;[[Spirit (Bauhaus song)|Spirit]]&quot;, produced by [[Hugh Jones (producer)|Hugh Jones]] and intended to break into the Top 30. However, &quot;Spirit&quot; only reached number 42. The band was displeased with the single and re-recorded it for their third album ''[[The Sky's Gone Out]]'', in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year Bauhaus scored their biggest hit with a cover of [[David Bowie]]'s &quot;[[Ziggy Stardust (song)|Ziggy Stardust]]&quot;, which was recorded during a BBC session. The song reached number 15 on the British charts and earned the band an appearance on the television show ''[[Top of the Pops]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Shirley, p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; Thanks to the success of the single, the album also became the band's biggest hit, peaking at number four.&lt;ref&gt;Shirley, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; That same year Bauhaus made an appearance in the horror film ''[[The Hunger (1983 film)|The Hunger]]'', where they performed &quot;Bela Lugosi's Dead&quot; during the opening credits. The final cut of the scene focused on Murphy; this, coupled with the singer's modelling work in a popular ad campaign for [[Maxell]], caused resentment among the rest of the group.&lt;ref&gt;Shirley, pp.&amp;nbsp;91–93&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the recording of their fourth album ''[[Burning from the Inside]]'' (1983) Peter Murphy was stricken with pneumonia, which prevented him from contributing much to the album. Daniel Ash and David J took the reins and became the driving forces behind the record, and even did lead vocals on a few tracks.&lt;ref&gt;Shirley, pp.&amp;nbsp;96–97&lt;/ref&gt; The album's lead single, &quot;[[She's in Parties]]&quot;, reached number 26 on the charts and earned Bauhaus their third and final ''Top of the Pops'' appearance.&lt;ref&gt;Shirley, p. 99&lt;/ref&gt; Bauhaus then embarked on an international promotional tour for the album, with dates in Europe and the Far East.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thompson, p. 137&quot;&gt;Thompson, p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; David J recalled that the night before they were supposed to perform two shows at [[Hammersmith Palais]] in London the group decided to disband. The band played their farewell show on 5 July 1983 at the Hammersmith Palais; dedicated fans had been warned by the band's crew not to miss the show without telling them it was the last. After a long [[encore (concert)|encore]] consisting of some of their early songs, David J left the stage with the words &quot;rest in peace&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thompson, p. 137&quot;/&gt; ''Burning from the Inside'' was released a week later. The album received largely positive reviews and reached number 13 on the charts.&lt;ref&gt;Shirley, p. 100&lt;/ref&gt; Bauhaus released the single &quot;Sanity Assassin&quot; in limited quantities as a farewell gift for those who joined the group's fanclub.&lt;ref&gt;Shirley, p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Post-breakup ===

After Bauhaus disbanded, the members of the band did various solo work. Peter Murphy worked briefly with bassist [[Mick Karn]] of [[Japan (band)|Japan]] in the band [[Dalis Car]] before going solo with such albums as 1988's ''[[Love Hysteria]]'' and 1989's ''[[Deep (album)|Deep]]''. Daniel Ash had already started [[Tones on Tail]] with Bauhaus roadie Glen Campling as a side-project in 1981; after Bauhaus broke up Kevin Haskins joined the group, which released an album and several EPs before breaking up following a 1984 American tour.&lt;ref name=&quot;RS&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/bauhaus/biography |title=Bauhaus |work=rollingstone.com |accessdate=24 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time David J released two solo albums and collaborated with other musicians, recording two albums with [[The Jazz Butcher]], and also with comics writer/spoken-word artist [[Alan Moore]] in the short-lived band The Sinister Ducks.

During a discussion about the state of their projects at the time, Ash and David J began talking about reforming Bauhaus. All four band members arranged a rehearsal, but Murphy failed to show up the day it was scheduled. The other three band members rehearsed regardless, and were inspired by the chemistry they had as a trio. As a result, Ash and the Haskins brothers formed [[Love and Rockets (band)|Love and Rockets]] in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;Shirley, pp. 113–14&lt;/ref&gt; Love and Rockets scored a US hit four years later with &quot;[[So Alive (Love and Rockets song)|So Alive]]&quot;. The band broke up after seven albums in 1999. Both Daniel Ash and David J released solo albums during the Love and Rockets years; Peter Murphy contributed backing vocals to David J's 1992 single &quot;Candy on the Cross&quot;.

=== Reunions ===

Bauhaus reunited for the &quot;Resurrection Tour&quot; in 1998, which featured a new song, &quot;The Dog's a Vapour&quot;, which was also included in the soundtrack for the film ''[[Heavy Metal 2000]]''. A [[live album]] recorded during the tour, ''[[Gotham (album)|Gotham]]'', was released the following year and included a studio recording of the [[Dead Can Dance]] song &quot;Severance&quot;.

Bauhaus reunited again in 2005, playing that year's [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival]] in [[Indio, California|Indio]], [[California]]. At the opening of their set, Peter Murphy was lowered to the stage upside-down singing &quot;Bela Lugosi's Dead&quot;. Following Peter Murphy's 2005 tour, Bauhaus embarked on a full tour beginning in [[North America]] and [[Mexico]] in the autumn of 2005 and ending in [[Europe]] in February 2006. The band also mentioned that they hoped to record new music following the tour. In May 2006 the band toured with [[Nine Inch Nails]] on the summer leg of their tour.

Bauhaus released their first new studio album since 1983, ''[[Go Away White]]'', in 2008. This marked the end of the band and there was no supporting tour.

== Musical style ==

Bauhaus combined a number of influences including [[Punk rock|punk]] music, [[glam rock]], and [[Krautrock]]—even [[funk]] and [[dub music|dub]]—to create a gloomy and introspective sound which appealed to many fans left disillusioned by the [[New Wave music|New Wave]] that arose in the wake of punk's collapse. Their sound proved influential and inspiring to a whole wave of [[post-punk]] groups delving into the intense, gloomy style that would eventually come to be known as [[gothic rock]]. Its crucial elements included Peter Murphy's deep and sonorous voice, Daniel Ash's innovative guitar playing, and David J's dub-influenced bass.

Making his television debut in 1948, he quickly expanded to over 50 television appearances two years later. Nielsen made his film debut in 1956, and began collecting his roles in [[Drama film|dramas]], [[Western (genre)|westerns]], and [[romance film]]s between the 1950s and the 1970s. Nielsen's performance in the films ''[[Forbidden Planet]]'' and ''[[The Poseidon Adventure (1972 film)|The Poseidon Adventure]]'' received positive reviews as a serious actor, although he is primarily known for his comedic roles during the 1980s and the early 1990s.

Although Nielsen's acting career crossed a variety of genres in both television and films, his deadpan delivery in ''[[Airplane!]]'' marked a turning point in his career, one that would make him, in the words of film critic [[Roger Ebert]], &quot;the [[Laurence Olivier|Olivier]] of spoofs.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ebert&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Ebert|first=Roger|authorlink=Roger Ebert|title=Scary Movie 3|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20031024/REVIEWS/310240305/1023|date=24 October 2003|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5ue0sIuNQ|archivedate=1 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nielsen enjoyed further success with [[The Naked Gun|''The Naked Gun'' film series]], based on an earlier short-lived television series ''[[Police Squad!]]'' in which he also starred. Nielsen's portrayal of comedic characters seemingly oblivious to (and complicit in) their absurd surroundings gave him a reputation as a comedian.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Maslin|first=Janet|title=Review/Film; A Fall Guy as Antihero|work=The New York Times|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE3DE153DF931A35751C1A96E948260|date=2 December 1988|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5ue0vHQMY|archivedate=1 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the final years of his life, Nielsen appeared in numerous spoof and parody films, many of which were met poorly by critics, but performed well in box office and home media releases. Nielsen married four times and had two daughters from his second marriage. Nielsen was recognized with a variety of awards throughout his career, and was inducted into the [[Canada's Walk of Fame|Canada]] and [[Hollywood Walk of Fame|Hollywood]] Walks of Fame.

==Early life==
[[File:HersholtBrotherswife.jpg|thumb|230px|left|Nielsen's uncle [[Jean Hersholt]] (pictured here in the 1936 film ''His Brother's Wife'') inspired him to become an actor.]]

His half-uncle, [[Jean Hersholt]], was an actor best known for his portrayal of [[Dr. Christian]] in the long-running radio series of the same name and the subsequent television series and films.&lt;ref name=&quot;nielsen1994&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=ote&gt;{{Cite book|last=Nielsen|first=Leslie|coauthors=David Fisher|title=Leslie Nielsen the naked truth|publisher=Pocket Books|year=1994|pages=289|month=|url=|isbn=0-671-79578-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1994 ''[[The Boston Globe|Boston Globe]]'' article, Nielsen explained, &quot;I did learn very early that when I would mention my uncle, people would look at me as if I were the biggest liar in the world. Then I would take them home and show them 8-by-10 glossies, and things changed quite drastically. So I began to think that maybe this acting business was not a bad idea, much as I was very shy about it and certainly without courage regarding it. My uncle died not too long after I was in a position to know him. I regret that I had not a chance to know him better.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;nielsen1994&quot;/&gt;

His television appearances include parts in ''[[Justice (1954 TV series)|Justice]]'', ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'', ''[[The Virginian (TV series)|The Virginian]]'', and ''[[The Wild Wild West]]''. In 1961, he was the lead in a taut Los Angeles police drama called ''[[The New Breed (TV series)|The New Breed]]''. He guest starred in a 1964 episode of ''[[Daniel Boone (TV series)|Daniel Boone]]'' with [[Fess Parker]] and, in a minor but credited role, [[Jay Silverheels]]. In 1968, he had a major role in the pilot film for the popular police series ''[[Hawaii Five-O]]'', and later appeared in one of the seventh season episodes. In 1969, he had the leading role as a police officer in ''[[The Bold Ones: The Protectors]]''.

In 1972, Nielsen appeared as the ship's captain in the all-star disaster epic ''[[The Poseidon Adventure (1972 film)|The Poseidon Adventure]]''. He also starred in the [[William Girdler]]-directed 1977 action film ''Project: Kill''. His last dramatic role before portraying mainly comedy roles was the 1979 Canadian disaster film ''[[City on Fire (1979 film)|City on Fire]]'' in which he played a corrupt mayor. In 1980, he guest starred as Sinclair on the [[CBS]] [[miniseries]] ''[[The Chisholms]]''.

===''Airplane!'' and ''The Naked Gun''===
{{Main|Airplane!|The Naked Gun}}
Nielsen's supporting role in 1980's ''[[Airplane!]]'' was a major watershed in his career. The ethos of the movie, a parody of dramatic disaster films such as ''[[Zero Hour!]]'' and ''[[Airport (1970 film)|Airport]]'', is largely based on building a comedy around actors who were then known exclusively for their dramatic roles (other stars included [[Robert Stack]], [[Peter Graves]], and [[Lloyd Bridges]]). Nielsen was the movie's linchpin, his deadpan delivery contrasting with the continual absurdity surrounding him. When asked, &quot;Surely you can't be serious?&quot;, he responds with a curt, &quot;I am serious. And don't call me Shirley.&quot; In several interviews he later reflected on the significance of the comedic line: &quot;I thought it was amusing, but it never occurred to me that it was going to become a trademark. It's such a surprise...the thing comes out, people say, 'What did he say?!'&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;KJZZ&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Leslie Nielsen Interview (Radio)|publisher=KJZZ 91.5 FM|url=http://kjzz.org/news/arizona/archives/200402/leslieneilsen|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5ufWDXbYT|archivedate=2 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nielsen also stated that he was &quot;...pleased and honored that [he] had a chance to deliver that line.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;YahooNe&quot;/&gt; The comedic exchange was at #79 on the [[American Film Institute]]'s [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AFI&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=AFI.com|work=AFI's 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes|url=http://www.afi.com/100years/quotes.aspx|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5ufWPg4p0|archivedate=2 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The American Film Institute also included the film in its list of the top ten comedy films of all time.&lt;ref name=&quot;MIL&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Dudek|first=Duane|title=25 years and still laughing; Airplane!' maintains its cruising|work=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]| url=http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=332493|accessdate=23 February 2009|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080430053901/http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=332493|archivedate=30 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Leslie Nielsen.jpg|thumb|right|Nielsen in 1982]]
Critics praised the film, which also proved to be a success with audiences.&lt;ref name=&quot;RT1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Airplane! (1980)| work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/airplane/|accessdate=23 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film's directors, [[Jim Abrahams]], [[David Zucker (filmmaker)|David Zucker]], and [[Jerry Zucker (film director)|Jerry Zucker]], chose Nielsen for the role based on his ability to play &quot;a fish in water&quot;, stating that &quot;You could have cast funny people and done it with everybody winking, goofing off, and silly...we wanted people to be oblivious to the comedy.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;MIL&quot;/&gt; For Nielsen, ''Airplane!'' marked a shift from dramatic roles to a new focus on [[deadpan|deadpan comedy]]. When it was suggested that his role in ''Airplane!'' was [[Typecasting (acting)|against type]], Nielsen protested that he had &quot;always been cast against type before,&quot; and that comedy was what he always really wanted to do.&lt;ref name=&quot;CastType&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Dalton|first=Andrew|last2=Thomas|first2=Bob|title='Airplane!', 'Forbidden Planet' actor Nielsen dies|work=[[The Monitor (Texas)|The Monitor]]|url=http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_OBIT_LESLIE_NIELSEN?SITE=TXMCA&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5ufWUN5CO|archivedate=2 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The directors, interested in the success of the new comedy, decided to bring a similar style of comedy to television, casting Nielsen in the lead role in their new series, ''[[Police Squad!]]''. The series introduced Nielsen as [[Frank Drebin]], the stereotypical police officer modeled after serious characters in earlier police TV series.

''Police Squad'''s opening sequence was based on the 1950s cop show ''[[M Squad]]'', (which starred [[Lee Marvin]]), which opened with footage of a [[police car]] roving through an after-dark urban setting with a big band playing a jazz theme song in the background. The voice-over and the show's organization into &quot;acts&quot; with an epilogue was homage to [[Quinn Martin]] police dramas including ''[[The Fugitive (TV series)|The Fugitive]]'', ''[[The Streets of San Francisco]]'', ''[[Barnaby Jones]]'', ''[[The F.B.I. (TV series)|The F.B.I.]]'', and ''[[Cannon (TV series)|Cannon]]''. Much like in ''Airplane!'', Nielsen portrayed a serious character whose one-liners appeared accidental next to the pratfalls and sight gags around him. Although the show was quickly canceled, lasting only six episodes after being juggled between time slots, Nielsen received an ''[[Emmy Award]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/leslie-nielsen Leslie Nielsen Emmy Award Winner]&lt;/ref&gt; nomination for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series|Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BIO&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Leslie Nielsen|publisher=[[The Biography Channel]]|url=http://www.thebiographychannel.co.uk/biography_story/150:519/1/Leslie_Nielsen.htm|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5ufWoKHlM|archivedate=2 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-comedic roles included ''[[Prom Night (1980 film)|Prom Night]]'' (1980) and ''[[Creepshow]]'' (1982), both horror films. His last dramatic role was as Allen Green, a violent john killed in self-defense by [[Barbra Streisand]]'s prostitute character, Claudia Draper, in [[Martin Ritt]]'s courtroom drama ''[[Nuts (film)|Nuts]]'' (1987).

Six years after the cancellation of ''Police Squad!'', its directors decided to make a feature length version for theaters. Titled ''[[The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!]]''. The film returned Nielsen to his role as Frank Drebin. It involved a comical scheme of a ruthless drug kingpin using hypnosis in an attempt to assassinate Queen [[Elizabeth II]]. Drebin, like the doctor in ''Airplane!'', seemed unaware of the absurdity around him even when unintentionally contributing toward it. Nielsen later said in an interview that he had done many of his own stunts, &quot;You have an idea of how you're going to do something, and it's your vision... unless you do it, it really doesn't stand a chance.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;KJZZ&quot;/&gt; This movie grossed over $78&amp;nbsp;million at the box office and was well received by critics.&lt;ref name=&quot;MOJO&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!|work=[[Box Office Mojo]]|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=nakedgun.htm|accessdate=23 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;RT2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=The Naked Gun – From the Files of Police Squad!

''[[The Naked Gun]]'' spawned two sequels: ''[[The Naked Gun 2½: The Smell of Fear]]'' (1991) and ''[[Naked Gun 33⅓: The Final Insult]]'' (1994). ''Naked Gun 2½'' grossed more than the original, with $86,930,400, while ''Naked Gun 33⅓'' grossed $51,132,600 in receipts.&lt;ref name=&quot;MOJO2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=The Naked Gun 2½: The Smell of Fear|work=[[Box Office Mojo]]|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=thenakedgun2.htm|accessdate=23 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MOJO3&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=The Naked Gun 33⅓: The Final Insult|work=[[Box Office Mojo]]|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=thenakedgun3.htm|accessdate=23 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nielsen remained open to the prospects of acting in a fourth ''Naked Gun'' film, although he doubted that it would ever be produced—&quot;I don't think so,&quot; he said in 2005. &quot;If there hasn't been one by now, I doubt it.

Nielsen briefly appeared on the World Wrestling Federation program in the summer of 1994 on ''[[WWE Raw|WWF Monday Night Raw]]''; capitalizing on his Frank Drebin character, Nielsen (and [[George Kennedy]]) were hired as &quot;super-sleuths&quot; to unravel the mystery of [[The Undertaker]] who had disappeared at January's [[Royal Rumble (1994)|Royal Rumble]] event. At [[SummerSlam (1994)|SummerSlam 1994]], in a ''Naked Gun'' parody, they were hot on the case (in fact, they were literally standing on a case). Although they did not actually find The Undertaker, the case had been closed (the literal case had been shut) and thus, they solved the mystery.&lt;ref name=wcrap&gt;{{cite book|title=Wrestlecrap: The Very Worst of Pro Wrestling|last=Baer|first=Randy |coauthors=R.D. Reynolds|publisher=ECW Press|year=2003|page=168|isbn=1-55022-584-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later comedies===
Nielsen attempted a variety of similar roles with none achieving the prominence of Frank Drebin. These films mostly emulated the style of ''[[The Naked Gun]]'' series with varying degrees of critical and commercial success: many were panned by critics and most performed poorly. In 1986, Nielsen played against recent type as a dramatic (and unsympathetic) character in the comedy, ''[[Soul Man (film)|Soul Man]]''. In 1990, Nielsen also appeared as a Frank Drebin-style character in a series of advertisements in the United Kingdom for [[Red Rock Cider]].

Although ''The Naked Gun'' series parodied police dramas in general, Nielsen's later parody films focused on specific targets. Critics panned ''[[Repossessed (film)|Repossessed]]'' (1990) and ''[[2001: A Space Travesty]]'' (2001), parodies of ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'' and ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'', respectively. Both films attempted the absurdist comedy Nielsen is recognized for, but were poorly received.&lt;ref name=&quot;RT5&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Repossessed|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/repossessed/|accessdate=23 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;RT6&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=2001: A Space Travesty (2001)|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/2001_a_space_travesty/|accessdate=23 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even a leading role in a [[Mel Brooks]] comic horror parody, ''[[Dracula: Dead and Loving It]]'', failed to generate much box office excitement, although it did gain somewhat of a following on its later release to video. Both 1996's ''[[Spy Hard]]'' and 1998's ''[[Wrongfully Accused]]'', a parody of [[James Bond in film|James Bond films]] and ''[[The Fugitive (1993 film)|The Fugitive]]'', respectively, received more popularity on home video but were not well received by critics.&lt;ref name=&quot;RT3&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Spy Hard|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/spy_hard/|accessdate=23 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;RT4&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Wrongfully Accused|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/wrongfully_accused/|accessdate=23 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His attempt at children's comedies met with additional criticism. ''[[Surf Ninjas]]'' (1993) and ''[[Mr. Magoo (film)|Mr. Magoo]]'' (1997) faced scathing reviews. Several critics were disappointed that Nielsen's role in ''Surf Ninjas'' was only &quot;an extended cameo&quot; and film critic Chris Hicks recommended that viewers &quot;...avoid any comedy that features Leslie Nielsen outside of the ''Naked Gun'' series.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Variety&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Kimmel|first=Daniel M.|title=Surf Ninjas|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117901158.html?categoryid=31&amp;cs=1&amp;query=daniel+and+kimmel&amp;display=daniel+kimmel|date=23 August 1993|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5ufX4w1gj|archivedate=2 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;DNews&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Hicks|first=Chris|title=Surf Ninjas|work=[[Deseret News]]|url=http://deseretnews.com/movies/view/1,1257,1780,00.html|date=26 August 1993|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5ufX7wXAO|archivedate=2 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jeff Miller of the ''[[Houston Chronicle]]'' panned ''Mr. Magoo'', a live action remake of the [[Mr. Magoo|1950s cartoon]], by saying, &quot;I'm supposed to suggest how the film might be better but I can't think of anything to say other than to make the film again.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;HChron&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Miller|first=Jeff|title=Looking for laughs?

Nielsen's first major slapstick success since ''[[The Naked Gun]]'' came in a supporting role in ''[[Scary Movie 3]]'' (2003). His appearance as President Harris proved popular enough for a second appearance in its sequel, ''[[Scary Movie 4]]'' (2006). This became the first time Nielsen reprised a character since his appearances as Frank Drebin. In one scene, Nielsen appeared almost fully [[Nudity|nude]], and one critic referred to the scene as putting &quot;the 'scary' in ''Scary Movie 4''.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;RVs&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Berardinelli|first=James|title=Scary Movie 4|publisher=ReelViews|url=http://www.reelviews.net/movies/s/scary_movie4.html|year=2006|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5ufXByyQF|archivedate=2 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nielsen also hosted a series of instructional golf videos beginning with 1993's ''[[Bad Golf Made Easier]]''. The videos were not serious, instead combining absurdist comedy with golf techniques. The series were popular enough to spawn two additional sequels, ''[[Bad Golf My Way]]'' (1994) and ''[[Stupid Little Golf Video]]'' (1997). Nielsen also co-wrote a fictional autobiography titled [[The Naked Truth (novel)|''The Naked Truth'']]. The book portrayed Nielsen as a popular actor with a long history of prestigious films.

===Final years===
[[File:Leslie nielsen at moravian college.JPG|thumb|left|Leslie Nielsen in 2009 at [[DeSales University]] in [[Center Valley, Pennsylvania|Center Valley]], Pennsylvania.]]
Even in his eighties, Nielsen continued to have an active career. He performed serious roles on screen and stage (such as his one-man theatre show ''Darrow'', in which he played [[Clarence Darrow]]), as well as providing voice-overs and on-camera appearances for commercials; cartoons like ''[[Zeroman]]'' where he had the leading role/voice; children's shows, such as ''[[Pumper Pups]]'', which he narrated, in addition to comedic film roles. The sibling relationship with his elder brother, [[the Honourable]] [[Erik Nielsen]], a former [[Prime Minister of Canada|Deputy Prime Minister of Canada]], served as the premise of an [[HBO]] [[mockumentary]] entitled ''[[The Canadian Conspiracy]]'' in which Leslie Nielsen appeared, along with other prominent Canadian-born media personalities. He was a celebrity contestant on CBS's ''[[Gameshow Marathon (U.S. TV series)|Gameshow Marathon]]'', where he played ''[[The Price Is Right]]'', ''[[Let's Make a Deal]]'', ''[[Beat the Clock]]'', and ''[[Press Your Luck]]'' for charity.&lt;ref name=&quot;CBS&quot;/&gt;

Beginning in February 2007, Nielsen began playing a small role as a doctor in the humorous yet educational television show ''[[Doctor*Ology]]''. The show chronicles real-life medical techniques and technology, and airs on the [[Discovery Channel]]. In an interview, Nielsen admitted his admiration for the doctors on the show: &quot;There are any number of things that you think about when you ponder if you hadn't been an actor, what would you be, and I've always said I'd like to be an astronaut or a doctor. I have such admiration for doctors. I just don't know how you go around to thank them enough for coming up with the world's most remarkable new discoveries.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;YahooNe&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Legendary Leslie Nielsen reluctant to slow down at 81|work=[[The Vancouver Sun]]|date=2 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

I do, however, wish to work enough to maintain whatever celebrity status I have so that they will continue to invite me to golf tournaments.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Tribute&quot;/&gt; Nielsen's interest in the sport led him to star in several comedic instructional films.

===Television===
&lt;!-- Note: Nielsen's complete filmography of film and television takes up 220 listings according to The Internet Movie Database, not including appearances on television specials such as Circus of the Stars, game shows such as Match Point, and documentary narration. Obviously, that all can't fit in this article without making it a giant list. As such, if you choose to make an addition, please ensure there's a Wikipedia article for that listing and that it was an influential role in his career. --&gt;

'''Ivan &quot;Ivo&quot; Andrić''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Иво Андрић}}, {{IPA-sh|ǐʋan ǐːʋɔ ǎːndritɕ|pron}}) (9 October 1892 – 13 March 1975) was a [[Yugoslavs|Yugoslav]] novelist,&lt;ref&gt;Zoltan D. Barany, ''The East European Gypsies: Regime Change, Marginality, and Ethnopolitics'' (Cambridge University Press, 2001: ISBN 0-521-00910-3),[http://books.google.com/books?id=yTylND961ZMC&amp;pg=PA59 p. 59].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rajko Đurić, ''Romanies and Europe: Romanies as Characters in European Literature'' (Council of Europe, 1996: ISBN 92-871-2855-3), [http://books.google.com/books?id=vbcK0mnVVuwC&amp;pg=PA11 p. 11].&lt;/ref&gt; short story writer, and the 1961 winner of the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]].&lt;ref name = NYTimes/&gt; His writings dealt mainly with life in his native [[Bosnia Eyalet|Bosnia]] under the [[Ottoman Empire]]. His native house in [[Travnik]] has been transformed into a Museum, and his [[Belgrade]] flat on [[Andrićev Venac]] hosts the [[Museum of Ivo Andrić]], and [[Ivo Andrić Foundation]].

==Biography==
Ivan Andrić was born on 9 October 1892, to [[Croats|Croatia]]n&lt;ref&gt;http://www.library.yale.edu/slavic/croatia/literature/literature.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://ivoandric.cz/en/biography&lt;/ref&gt; parents in [[Travnik]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], then part of [[Austria-Hungary]]. He was born as Ivan, but became known by the [[diminutive]] Ivo. When Andrić was two years old, his father Antun died. Because his mother Katarina was too poor to support him, he was raised by his mother's family in the town of [[Višegrad]] on the river [[Drina River|Drina]] in eastern [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]], where he saw the 16th-century [[Mehmed Paša Sokolović Bridge]], later made famous in his novel ''[[The Bridge on the Drina]]'' (''Na Drini ćuprija'').&lt;ref&gt;Richard C. Frucht (ed.), ''Eastern Europe: An Introduction to the People, Lands, and Culture'' (ABC-CLIO, 2005: ISBN 1-57607-800-0), [http://books.google.com/books?id=lVBB1a0rC70C&amp;pg=RA2-PA568 p. 568].&lt;/ref&gt;

Andrić attended the Jesuit gymnasium in [[Travnik]], followed by [[Sarajevo]]'s [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] and later he studied philosophy at the Universities of [[Zagreb]] (1912 and 1918), [[Vienna]] (1913), [[Kraków]] (1914), and [[Graz]] (PhD, 1924).&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3435000021.html Andrić, Ivo],&quot; ''Encyclopedia of World Biography'', 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of his political activities, Andrić was imprisoned by the Austrian government during [[World War I]] (first in [[Maribor]] and later in the [[Doboj]] detention camp) alongside other pro-Yugoslav civilians.

Andric started his literary career as a poet. In 1914 he was one of the contributors to Hrvatska mlada lirika (Young Croatian Lyrics).&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1961/andric-bio.html The Nobel Prize in Literature 1961]&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the newly-formed [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes]] (later [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]) Andrić became a civil servant, first in the Ministry of Faiths and then the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, where he pursued a successful diplomatic career as Deputy Foreign Minister.

During his diplomatic service, he worked in embassy at [[Holy See]] (1920), consulates in [[Bucharest]], [[Trieste]] and Graz (1924), consulates in Paris and [[Marseilles]] (1927), and embassy in [[Madrid]] (1928). In 1939 he was appointed ambassador in Germany. He was also a delegate of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia at the 19th, 21st, 23rd and 24th sessions of the [[League of Nations]] in Geneva in period 1930–1934.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indiana.edu/~league/assemblydelega.htm List of Assembly Delegates and Substitutes – (A)] from League of Nations Photo Archive at the University of Indiana&lt;/ref&gt; Andrić greatly opposed the movement of [[Stjepan Radić]], the president of the [[Croatian Peasant Party]]. His ambassadorship ended in 1941 after the German invasion of Yugoslavia. During [[World War II]], Andrić lived quietly in [[Belgrade]], completing  three of his most famous novels which were published in 1945, including ''The Bridge on the Drina''.

After the war, Andrić spent most of his time in his home in [[Belgrade]] and held a number of ceremonial posts in the new Communist government of Yugoslavia, and was also a member of the Parliament of Bosnia and Herzegovina. In 1961, he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature &quot;for the epic force with which he has traced themes and depicted human destinies drawn from the history of his country&quot;. He donated all of the prize money for the improvement of libraries in Bosnia and Herzegovina. He was member of the [[Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sanu.ac.rs/English/Adresar.aspx SANU]&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the death of his second wife, Milica Babić-Andrić, in 1968, he began reducing his public activities. In 1969 he was elected an honorary member of the [[Academy of Sciences and Arts of Bosnia and Herzegovina]].&lt;ref&gt;Akademija nauka i umjetnosti Bosne i Hercegovine, [http://www.anubih.ba/index.php?option=content&amp;lang=eng&amp;Theme=honorary&amp;Level=2&amp;ItemID=6 Honorary members]&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1972 the [[University of Belgrade]] awarded him an honorary doctorate.&lt;ref&gt;Univerzitet u Beogradu: [http://www.bg.ac.rs/csrp/nauka/pocasni_doktori.php počasni doktori]&lt;/ref&gt; As time went by, he grew increasingly ill and eventually died on 13 March 1975, in [[Belgrade]], [[SR Serbia]], [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|SFR Yugoslavia]].

He was buried in the [[Novo groblje|Belgrade New Cemetery]], in the [[Novo groblje#Alley of Distinguished Citizens|Alley of Distinguished Citizens]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beogradskagroblja.rs/licnosti.php?lan=eng&amp;id=5 Ivo Andrić, Novo Groblje]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
[[File:Ivo Andric in Višegrad.jpg|thumb|right|Ivo Andrić and [[Mehmed Paša Sokolović Bridge]] in [[Višegrad]], Bosnia and Herzegovina]]
The material for his works was mainly drawn from the [[History of Bosnia and Herzegovina|history]], [[folklore]], and [[Bosnian Culture|culture]] of his native [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]].

Those were all released in 1945 and written during [[World War II]] while Andrić was living quietly in Belgrade. They are often referred to as the''&quot;Bosnian trilogy&quot;'' as they were released simultaneously and had been written in the same period. However, they are connected only thematically—they are indeed three completely different works.

Some of his other popular works include:
*''Ex Ponto''&lt;ref name=&quot;ivoandric1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ivoandric.org.rs/html/lyricists.html |title=Lyricists |publisher=Ivoandric.org.rs|accessdate=June 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1918)

His manuscripts and literary legacy are in the custody of the foundation he founded ([[Museum of Ivo Andrić|Fondacija Ive Andrića]]) and [[Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts]].&lt;ref&gt;Ivo Andrić Foundation, [http://www.ivoandric.org.rs/html/work.html Work]&lt;/ref&gt; Some of his manuscripts and literary legacy are in custody of the [[Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts]], the Institute for the History of Croatian Literature, Theater and Music in Zagreb.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sapunar&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Sapunar |first=Andrea |editor1-last=Sabljak |editor1-first=Tomislav |editor2-last=Hećimović |editor2-first=Branko |editor3-last=Katalinić |editor3-first=Vjera |editor4-last=Matičević |editor4-first=Ivica |title=Vodič Zavoda za povijest hrvatske književnosti, kazališta i glazbe Hrvatske akademije znanosti i umjetnosti |publisher=Hrvatska akademija znanosti i umjetnosti |location=Zagreb |year=2001 |pages=111.–120 |chapter=Popis rukopisnih ostavština u Arhivu Odsjeka}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some claim that the works of Andrić, particularly his thesis ''The Development of Spiritual Life in Bosnia under the Influence of Turkish Rule'' have resurfaced as a source of [[anti-Muslim]] prejudice in Serbian cultural discourse.&lt;ref&gt;Ammiel Alcalay, ''Memories of Our Future: Selected Essays 1982–1999'' (City Lights Books, 1999: ISBN 0-87286-360-3), [http://books.google.com/books?id=4mBwBf-U-lQC&amp;pg=PA233 p. 233].&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of what language or dialect he wrote in, he wrote in [[Serbo-Croatian]], which was officially considered one language in Yugoslavia; he had been a believer in [[Yugoslavs|Yugoslav]] unity and [[Pan-slavism]]. However, it must be mentioned that [[Serbo-Croatian]] used to have two different subtypes – the Eastern standardization (spread in [[Montenegro]], Serbia and partly in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]), and Western standardization that is common in [[Croatia]] and partly in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Although Andrić mostly used the Serbian form of Serbo-Croatian ([[ekavian accent]] of Shtokavian dialect, commonly spoken in Serbia), his early works were written in the Bosnian-Croatian-Montenegrin form ([[ijekavian accent]] of the Shtokavian dialect, commonly spoken in Bosnia).&lt;ref name=britannica/&gt;

There was also a more specific, and more fundamental, divide—that between [[ekavian]] and [[ijekavian]] standards of then-[[Serbo-Croat]] – Andrić wrote in the ijekavian form (standard in both Western standard Croatia, middle-of-the-road standard Bosnia-Herzegovina, and Eastern standard Montenegro) only in his youth. As a mature writer, he wrote and published in ekavian (the official standard only in Serbia), even when depicting characters who live in Bosnia and who are quoted as speaking ijekavian accent in the dialogues, that stand out in otherwise ekavian text.

Andrić never used the translated equivalents of foreign words, as used to be common in Eastern standard.
[[File:Grob Ive Andrića.jpg|thumb|Ivo Andrić's grave in Belgrade, Serbia.]]
Bosnians celebrate Andrić as a native son, as he was born and raised in Bosnia and set most of his stories in his native land. His doctoral thesis was on the cultural history of Bosnia under Turkish rule titled ''The Development of Spiritual Life in Bosnia under the Influence of Turkish Rule'', an example of one of his many writings dealing with Bosnia.

Croatians point to his Croat heritage—both of his parents were Roman Catholic Croats in Bosnia. He declared himself a Croat while studying in Kraków in 1914, and had his work published in various Croatian publications. Andrić wrote in the Serbo-Croatian language's ijekavian accent until the formation of the Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes (later the Kingdom of Yugoslavia) and his move to Belgrade, where he began writing in Serbian and embraced the Yugoslav cause.

Serbian sources claim him as a Serbian writer, saying that he mainly wrote in the ekavian standard that exists only in the Serbian language. He declared himself a Serb when he married Serbian Milica Babić at the age of 67 in 1958.&lt;ref name=&quot;Radovan Popović page 240&quot;&gt;''[http://books.google.com/books?id=Z_DGSAAACAAJ&amp;dq=Andri%C4%87eva%20prijateljstva&amp;source=gbs_book_other_versions Andrićeva prijateljstva]'', Radovan Popović, 2009, page 240&lt;/ref&gt; He also became a member of the [[Serbian Academy of Science and Arts]].

'''Fusion power''' is the [[power (physics)|power]] generated by [[nuclear fusion]] processes. In fusion reactions two light [[atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]] fuse together to form a heavier nucleus (in contrast with [[fission power]]). In doing so they release a comparatively large amount of energy arising from the [[binding energy]] due to the [[strong nuclear force]] which is manifested as an increase in [[temperature]] of the reactants. Fusion power is a primary area of research in [[plasma physics]].

The term is commonly used to refer to potential commercial production of net usable power from a fusion source, similar to the usage of the term &quot;[[steam engine|steam power]].&quot; The leading designs for controlled fusion research use [[magnetic confinement|magnetic]] ([[tokamak]] design) or [[inertial confinement|inertial]] ([[laser]]) confinement of a [[plasma (physics)|plasma]], with [[heat]] from the fusion reactions used to operate a [[steam turbine]] which in turn drives [[electrical generator]]s, similar to the process used in [[fossil fuel]] and [[fission power|nuclear fission]] [[power station]]s.

{{As of|2010|07|}}, the largest experiment by means of magnetic confinement has been the [[Joint European Torus]] (JET). In 1997, JET produced a peak of {{convert|16.1|MW|lk=on}} of fusion power (65% of input power), with fusion power of over {{convert|10|MW|abbr=on}} sustained for over 0.5&amp;nbsp;sec. Its successor, the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor ([[ITER]]), was officially announced as part of a seven-country consortium.&lt;ref name=&quot;announcement&quot;&gt;[http://www.pppl.gov/polImage.cfm?doc_Id=603&amp;size_code=Doc ITER and the Promise of Fusion Energy].&lt;/ref&gt; [[ITER]] is designed to produce ten times more fusion power than the power put into the [[Plasma (physics)#Artificial plasmas|plasma]]. [[ITER]] is currently under construction in [[Cadarache]], France.

Inertial (laser) confinement, which was for a time seen as more difficult or infeasible, has generally seen less development effort than magnetic approaches. However, this approach made a comeback following further innovations, and is being developed at both the [[United States]] [[National Ignition Facility]], the [[France|French]] [[Laser Mégajoule]] as well as the planned [[European Union]] [[HiPER|High Power laser Energy Research]] (HiPER) facility. NIF reached initial operational status in 2010 and has been in the process of increasing the power and energy of its &quot;shots&quot;. Fusion ignition tests are to follow.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oct8_10&quot;&gt;{{cite web |  title = First successful integrated experiment at National Ignition Facility announced | work = General Physics | publisher = PhysOrg.com  | date = October 8, 2010 | url = http://www.physorg.com/news205740709.html  | accessdate = 2010-10-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fusion powered electricity generation was initially believed to be readily achievable, as fission power had been. However, the extreme requirements for continuous reactions and [[plasma containment]] led to projections being extended by several decades. In 2010, more than 60 years after the first attempts, commercial power production was still believed to be unlikely before 2050.&lt;ref name=&quot;ITERorg&quot;&gt;{{cite web |work=The ITER Project |title=Beyond ITER |publisher=Information Services, Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory |url=http://www.iter.org/Future-beyond.htm |accessdate=5 February 2011 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061107220145/http://www.iter.org/Future-beyond.htm |archivedate=7 November 2006 }} - Projected fusion power timeline&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fuel cycle==
[[Image:fusion rxnrate.svg|right|300px|thumb|The fusion reaction rate increases rapidly with temperature until it maximizes and then gradually drops off. The deuterium-tritium fusion rate peaks at a lower temperature (about 70&amp;nbsp;keV, or 800 million kelvin) and at a higher value than other reactions commonly considered for fusion energy.]]

The basic concept behind any fusion reaction is to bring two or more nuclei close enough together so that the [[strong interaction|residual strong force]] (nuclear force) in their nuclei will pull them together into one larger nucleus. If two light nuclei fuse, they will generally form a single nucleus with a slightly smaller mass than the sum of their original masses (though this is not always the case). The difference in mass is released as energy according to [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[mass-energy equivalence]] formula ''E''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''mc''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. If the input nuclei are sufficiently massive, the resulting fusion product will be heavier than the sum of the reactants' original masses, in which case the reaction requires an external source of energy. The dividing line between &quot;light&quot; and &quot;heavy&quot; is [[iron]]-56. Above this atomic mass, energy will generally be released by [[nuclear fission]] reactions; below it, by fusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/nucene/nucbin.html#c2|title=Fission and fusion can yield energy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fusion between the nuclei is opposed by the repulsive positive electrical charge common to all nuclei due to [[proton]]s in the nucleus. To overcome this [[electrostatic force]], or &quot;[[Coulomb barrier]]&quot;, the kinetic energy of the atoms must be increased. The easiest way to do this is to heat the atoms, which has the side effect of stripping the [[electron]]s from the atoms and leaving them as bare nuclei.

In most experiments the nuclei and electrons are left in a fluid known as a [[plasma (physics)|plasma]]. The temperatures required to provide the nuclei with enough energy to overcome their repulsion is a function of the total charge, so [[hydrogen]], which has the smallest nuclear charge therefore fuses at the lowest temperature. [[Helium]] has an extremely low mass per nucleon and therefore is energetically favoured as a fusion product. As a consequence, most [[Nuclear fusion#Important reactions|fusion reactions]] combine isotopes of hydrogen (&quot;[[Hydrogen atom|protium]]&quot;, [[deuterium]], or [[tritium]]) to form isotopes of helium ({{SimpleNuclide|Helium|3}} or {{SimpleNuclide|Helium|4}}) as the fusion end product.

The reaction '''[[cross section (physics)|cross section]]''', denoted σ, is a measure of the probability of a fusion reaction as a function of the relative velocity of the two reactant nuclei. If the reactants have a distribution of velocities, as is the case in a thermal distribution within a plasma, then it is useful to perform an average over the distributions of the product of cross section and velocity. The reaction rate (fusions per volume per time) is &amp;lt;σv&amp;gt; times the product of the reactant [[number density|number densities]]:

: &lt;big&gt;ƒ = (½n)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;lt;σv&amp;gt; &lt;/big&gt;(for one reactant)
: &lt;big&gt;ƒ = n&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;n&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;lt;σv&amp;gt; &lt;/big&gt;(for two reactants)

&amp;lt;σv&amp;gt; increases from virtually zero at room temperatures up to meaningful magnitudes at temperatures of {{convert|10|-|100|keV|abbr=on|lk=on}}. The significance of &amp;lt;σv&amp;gt; as a function of temperature in a device with a particular energy [[confinement time]] is found by considering the [[Lawson criterion]].

Perhaps the three most widely considered fuel cycles are based on the D-T, D-D, and p-{{SimpleNuclide|Boron|11}} reactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Atzeni|first=Stefano|title=The Physics of Inertial Fusion|year=2009|publisher=Oxford Science Publications|location=USA|isbn=978-0-19-956801-7|pages=12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other fuel cycles (D-{{SimpleNuclide|Helium|3}} and {{SimpleNuclide|Helium|3}}-{{SimpleNuclide|Helium|3}}) would require a supply of &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;He, either from other nuclear reactions or from extraterrestrial sources, such as the surface of the moon or the atmospheres of the gas giant planets. The details of the calculations comparing these reactions can be found [[D-T fusion|here]].

===D-T fuel cycle===
[[Image:Deuterium-tritium fusion.svg|thumb|Diagram of the D-T reaction]]
According to the [[Lawson criterion]], the easiest and most immediately promising nuclear reaction for fusion power is:

:{{Nuclide|Deuterium|link=yes}} + {{Nuclide|Tritium|link=yes}} → {{Nuclide|Helium|link=yes}} + {{SubatomicParticle|10neutron|link=yes}}

Hydrogen-2 ([[Deuterium]]) is a naturally occurring [[isotope]] of hydrogen and is commonly available. The large mass ratio of the hydrogen isotopes makes their separation easy compared to the difficult [[uranium enrichment]] process. Hydrogen-3 (Tritium) is also an isotope of hydrogen, but it occurs naturally in only negligible amounts due to its [[half-life]] of 12.32 years. Consequently, the deuterium-tritium fuel cycle requires the [[breeder reactor|breeding]] of [[tritium]] from [[lithium]] using one of the following reactions:

:{{SubatomicParticle|10neutron}} + {{Nuclide|Lithium|6}} → {{Nuclide|Tritium}} + {{Nuclide|Helium}}
:{{SubatomicParticle|10neutron}} + {{Nuclide|Lithium|7}} → {{Nuclide|Tritium}} + {{Nuclide|Helium}} + {{SubatomicParticle|10neutron}}

The reactant neutron is supplied by the D-T fusion reaction shown above, and the one that has the greatest yield of energy. The reaction with &lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;Li is [[exothermic reaction|exothermic]], providing a small energy gain for the reactor. The reaction with &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;Li is [[endothermic reaction|endothermic]] but does not consume the neutron. At least some &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;Li reactions are required to replace the neutrons lost to absorption by other elements. Most reactor designs use the naturally occurring mix of lithium isotopes.

Several drawbacks are commonly attributed to D-T fusion power:
# It produces substantial amounts of neutrons that result in the [[neutron activation]] of the reactor materials.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thinkquest&quot;&gt;{{cite web| publisher= | url=http://library.thinkquest.org/17940/texts/fusion_dt/fusion_dt.html | title= Thinkquest: D-T reaction | first= | last= | date= | accessdate=12 June 2010 | postscript= &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Only about 20% of the fusion energy yield appears in the form of charged particles with the remainder carried off by neutrons, which limits the extent to which direct energy conversion techniques might be applied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Iiyoshi|first=A|coauthors=H. Momota, O Motojima, et al.|title=Innovative Energy Production in Fusion Reactors|journal=National Institute for Fusion Science NIFS|year=1993|month=October|pages=2–3|url=http://www.nifs.ac.jp/report/nifs250.html|accessdate=14 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# It requires the handling of the radioisotope tritium. Similar to hydrogen, tritium is difficult to contain and may leak from reactors in some quantity. Some estimates suggest that this would represent a fairly large environmental release of radioactivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf66.html|title=Nuclear Fusion Power, Assessing fusion power}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[neutron flux]] expected in a commercial D-T fusion reactor is about 100 times that of current fission power reactors, posing problems for [[plasma facing material|material design]]. Design of suitable materials is under way but their actual use in a reactor is not proposed until the design generation after [[ITER]]. After a single series of D-T tests at [[Joint European Torus|JET]], the largest fusion reactor yet to use this fuel, the vacuum vessel was sufficiently radioactive that remote handling  was required for the year following the tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rolfe|first=A. C.|title=Remote Handling JET Experience|journal=Nuclear Energy|year=1999|volume=38|issue=5|page=6|url=http://www.iop.org/Jet/fulltext/JETP99028.pdf|accessdate=10 April 2012|issn=0140-4067}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a production setting, the neutrons would be used to react with [[lithium]] in order to create more tritium. This also deposits the energy of the neutrons in the lithium, which would then be transferred to drive electrical production. The lithium neutron absorption reaction protects the outer portions of the reactor from the neutron flux. Newer designs, the advanced tokamak in particular, also use lithium inside the reactor core as a key element of the design. The plasma interacts directly with the lithium, preventing a problem known as &quot;recycling&quot;. The advantage of this design was demonstrated in the [[Lithium Tokamak Experiment]].

===D-D fuel cycle===
Though more difficult to facilitate than the deuterium-tritium reaction, fusion can also be achieved through the reaction of deuterium with itself. This reaction has two branches that occur with nearly equal probability:
:{|
|D + D || → T || + &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H
|-
|D + D || → &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;He || + n
|}
The optimum energy to initiate this reaction is 15&amp;nbsp;keV, only slightly higher than the optimum for the D-T reaction. The first branch does not produce neutrons, but it does produce tritium, so that a D-D reactor will not be completely tritium-free, even though it does not require an input of tritium or lithium. Most of the tritium produced would be burned before leaving the reactor, which would reduce the handling of tritium, but would produce more neutrons, some of which are very energetic. The neutron from the second branch has an energy of only {{convert|2.45|MeV|abbr=on}}, whereas the neutron from the D-T reaction has an energy of {{convert|14.1|MeV|abbr=on}}, resulting in a wider range of isotope production and material damage.

Assuming complete tritium burn-up, the reduction in the fraction of fusion energy carried by neutrons would be only about 18%, so that the primary advantage of the D-D fuel cycle is that tritium breeding would not be required. Other advantages are independence from scarce lithium resources and a somewhat softer neutron spectrum. The disadvantage of D-D compared to D-T is that the energy confinement time (at a given pressure) must be 30 times longer and the power produced (at a given pressure and volume) would be 68 times less.

===D-&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;He fuel cycle===
A second-generation approach to controlled fusion power involves combining [[helium-3]] (&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;He) and [[deuterium]] (&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;H). This reaction produces a helium-4 nucleus (&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He) and a high-energy proton. As with the p-&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;B [[aneutronic fusion]] fuel cycle, most of the reaction energy is released as charged particles, reducing [[neutron activation|activation]] of the reactor housing and potentially allowing more efficient energy harvesting (via any of several speculative technologies){{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}. In practice, D-D side reactions produce a significant number of neutrons, resulting in p-&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;B being the preferred cycle for aneutronic fusion.

===p-&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;B fuel cycle===
If [[aneutronic fusion]] is the goal, then the most promising candidate may be the Hydrogen-1 (proton)/[[boron]] reaction:
:&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H + &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;B → 3&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He
Under reasonable assumptions, side reactions will result in about 0.1% of the fusion power being carried by neutrons.&lt;ref&gt;Heindler and Kernbichler, Proc. 5th Intl. Conf. on Emerging Nuclear Energy Systems, 1989, pp. 177-82. See also [[Aneutronic fusion#Residual radiation from a p–11B reactor|Residual radiation from a p–11B reactor]]&lt;/ref&gt; At 123 keV, the optimum temperature for this reaction is nearly ten times higher than that for the pure hydrogen reactions, the energy confinement must be 500 times better than that required for the D-T reaction, and the [[power density]] will be 2500 times lower than for D-T. Since the confinement properties of conventional approaches to fusion such as the tokamak and laser pellet fusion are marginal, most proposals for aneutronic fusion are based on radically different confinement concepts, such as the [[Polywell]] and the [[Dense Plasma Focus]].

==History of research==
===Brief overview===
The idea of using human-initiated fusion reactions was first made practical for military purposes in [[nuclear weapon]]s. In a hydrogen bomb, the energy released by a fission weapon is used to compress and heat fusion fuel, beginning a fusion reaction that releases a large amount of neutrons that increases the rate of fission. The first [[Fusion-boosted fission weapon|fission-fusion-fission-based]] weapons released some 500 times more energy than early fission weapons.

Attempts at controlling fusion for power production had already started by this point. Registration of the first patent related to a fusion reactor&lt;ref&gt;[http://v3.espacenet.com/textdoc?DB=EPODOC&amp;IDX=GB817681&amp;F=0 British Patent 817681, available here]&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority]], the inventors being [[George Paget Thomson|Sir George Paget Thomson]] and [[Moses Blackman]], dates back to 1946. This was the first detailed examination of the pinch concept, and small efforts to experiment with the pinch concept started at several sites in the UK.

Around the same time, an expatriate German [[Ronald Richter]] proposed the [[Huemul Project]] in Argentina, announcing positive results in 1951. Although these results turned out to be false, it sparked off intense interest around the world. The UK pinch programs were greatly expanded, culminating in the [[ZETA (fusion reactor)|ZETA]] and [[Sceptre (fusion reactor)|Sceptre]] devices. In the US, pinch experiments like those in the UK started at the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]]. Similar devices were built in the USSR after data on the UK program was passed to them by [[Klaus Fuchs]]. At [[Princeton University]] a new approach developed as the [[stellarator]], and the research establishment formed there continues to this day as the [[Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory]]. Not to be outdone, [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] entered the field with their own variation, the [[magnetic mirror]]. These three groups have remained the primary developers of fusion research in the US to this day.

In the time since these early experiments, two new approaches developed that have since come to dominate fusion research. The first was the [[tokamak]] approach developed in the Soviet Union, which combined features of the stellarator and the pinch to produce a device that dramatically outperformed either. The majority of magnetic fusion research to this day has followed the tokamak approach. In the late 1960s the concept of &quot;mechanical&quot; fusion through the use of [[laser]]s was developed in the US, and Lawrence Livermore switched their attention from mirrors to lasers over time.

Civilian applications are still being developed. Although it took less than ten years for fission to go from military applications to civilian fission energy production,&lt;ref&gt;The first A-bomb shot dates back to July 16, 1945 in [[Alamogordo]] ([[New Mexico]] desert), while the first civilian fission plant was connected to the electric power network on June 27, 1954 in [[Obninsk]] ([[Russia]]).&lt;/ref&gt; it has been very different in the fusion energy field; more than fifty years have already passed since the first fusion reaction took place&lt;ref&gt;The first H-bomb, [[Ivy Mike]], was detonated on [[Enewetak|Eniwetok]], an atoll of the [[Pacific Ocean]], on November 1, 1952 (local time).&lt;/ref&gt; and sixty years since the first attempts to produce controlled fusion power, without any commercial fusion energy production plant coming into operation.

===Magnetic containment===
====Pinch devices====

A major area of study in early fusion power research is the &quot;[[Pinch (plasma physics)|pinch]]&quot; concept. Pinch is based on the fact that plasmas are electrically conducting. By running a current through the plasma, a magnetic field will be generated around the plasma. This field will, according to [[Lenz's law]], create an inward directed force that causes the plasma to collapse inward, raising its density. Denser plasmas generate denser magnetic fields, increasing the inward force, leading to a [[chain reaction]]. If the conditions are correct, this can lead to the densities and temperatures needed for fusion. The difficulty is getting the current into the plasma; this is solved by inducing the current in the plasma by induction from an external magnet, which also produces the external field against which the internal field acts.

Pinch was first developed in the UK in the immediate post-war era. Starting in 1947 small experiments were carried out and plans were laid to build a much larger machine. When the Huemul results hit the news, [[James L. Tuck]], a UK physicist working at Los Alamos, introduced the pinch concept in the US and produced a series of machines known as the [[Perhapsatron]]. In the Soviet Union, unbeknownst to the west, a series of similar machines were being built. All of these devices quickly demonstrated a series of instabilities when the pinch was applied, which broke up the plasma column long before it reached the densities and temperatures required for fusion. In 1953 Tuck and others suggested a number of solutions to these problems.

The largest &quot;classic&quot; pinch device was the [[ZETA (fusion reactor)|ZETA]], including all of these upgrades, starting operations in the UK in 1957. In early 1958 [[John Cockcroft]] announced that fusion had been achieved in the ZETA, an announcement that made headlines around the world. When physicists in the US expressed concerns about the claims they were initially dismissed. However, US experiments demonstrated the same neutrons, although measurements suggested these could not be from fusion reactions. The neutrons seen in the UK were later demonstrated to be from different versions of the same instability processes that plagued earlier machines. Cockcroft was forced to retract the fusion claims, and the entire field was tainted for years. ZETA ended its experiments in 1968, and most other pinch experiments ended shortly after.

In 1974 a study of the ZETA results demonstrated an interesting side-effect; after an experimental run ended, the plasma would enter a short period of stability. This led to the [[reversed field pinch]] concept which has seen some level of development since. Recent work on the basic concept started as a result of the appearance of the &quot;wires array&quot; concept in the 1980s, which allowed a more efficient use of this technique. The [[Sandia National Laboratory]] runs a continuing wire-array research program with the [[Z machine|Zpinch]] machine. In addition, the [[University of Washington]]'s ZaP Lab&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aa.washington.edu/AERP/ZaP/ UW A&amp;A - Research Labs&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; has shown quiescent periods of stability hundreds of times longer than expected for plasma in a Z-pinch configuration, while the staged Z-pinch concept from University of California Irvine is based on similar concepts.&lt;ref&gt;Details of this concept are shown in various publications available on the web page of MIFTI [http://www.mifti.com/].&lt;/ref&gt;

====Early magnetic approaches====
The U.S. fusion program began in 1951 when [[Lyman Spitzer]] began work on a [[stellarator]] under the code name Project Matterhorn. His work led to the creation of the [[Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory]], where magnetically confined plasmas are still studied. Spitzer planned an aggressive development project of four machines, A, B, C, and D. A and B were small research devices, C would be the prototype of a power-producing machine, and D would be the prototype of a commercial device. A worked without issue, but even by the time B was being used it was clear the stellarator was also suffering from instabilities and plasma leakage. Progress on C slowed as attempts were made to correct for these problems.

At Lawrence Livermore, the [[magnetic mirror]] was the preferred approach. The mirror consisted of two large magnets arranged so they had strong fields within them, and a weaker, but connected, field between them. Plasma introduced in the area between the two magnets would &quot;bounce back&quot; from the stronger fields in the middle. Although the design would leak plasma through the mirrors, the rate of leakage would be low enough that a useful fusion rate could be maintained. The simplicity of the design was supposed to make up for its lower performance. In practice the mirror also suffered from mysterious leakage problems, and never reached the expected performance.

====Gun Club, MHD, instability; progress slows====
By the mid-1950s it was clear that the simple theoretical tools being used to calculate the performance of all fusion machines were simply not predicting their actual behaviour. Machines invariably leaked their plasma from their confinement area at rates far higher than predicted.

In 1954, [[Edward Teller]] held a gathering of fusion researchers at the Princeton Gun Club, near the Project Matterhorn (now known as [[Project Sherwood]]) grounds. Teller started by pointing out the problems that everyone was having, and suggested that any system where the plasma was confined within concave fields was doomed to fail. Attendees remember him saying something to the effect that the fields were like rubber bands, and they would attempt to snap back to a straight configuration whenever the power was increased, ejecting the plasma. He went on to say that it appeared the only way to confine the plasma in a stable configuration would be to use convex fields, a &quot;cusp&quot; configuration.&lt;ref&gt;Nathaniel Fisch, [http://books.google.com/books?id=9i9bgMLVjWsC&amp;pg=PA118 &quot;Edward Teller Centennial Symposium&quot;], pg 118&lt;/ref&gt;

When the meeting concluded, most of the researchers quickly turned out papers saying why Teller's concerns did not apply to their particular device. The pinch machines did not use magnetic fields in this way at all, while the mirror and stellarator seemed to have various ways out. However, this was soon followed by a paper by [[Martin David Kruskal]] and [[Martin Schwarzschild]] discussing pinch machines, which demonstrated instabilities in those devices were inherent to the design.

A series of similar studies followed, abandoning the simplistic theories previously used and introducing a full consideration of [[magnetohydrodynamics]] with a partially resistive plasma. These concepts developed quickly, and by the early 1960s it was clear that small devices simply would not work. A series of much larger and more complex devices followed as researchers attempted to add field upon field in order to provide the required field strength without reaching the unstable regimes. As cost and complexity climbed, the initial optimism of the fusion field faded.

====The tokamak is announced====
A new approach was outlined in the theoretical works fulfilled in 1950–1951 by [[Igor Tamm|I.E. Tamm]] and [[Andrei Sakharov|A.D. Sakharov]] in the [[Soviet Union]], which first discussed a [[tokamak]]-like approach. Experimental research on those designs began in 1956 at the [[Kurchatov Institute]] in [[Moscow]] by a group of Soviet scientists led by [[Lev Artsimovich]]. The tokamak essentially combined a low-power pinch device with a low-power simple stellarator. The key was to combine the fields in such a way that the particles orbited within the reactor a particular number of times, today known as the &quot;[[Safety factor (plasma physics)|safety factor]]&quot;. The combination of these fields dramatically improved confinement times and densities, resulting in huge improvements over existing devices.

The group constructed the first tokamaks, the most successful being the [[T-3 (tokamak)|T-3]] and its larger version [[T-4 (tokamak)|T-4]]. T-4 was tested in 1968 in [[Novosibirsk]], producing the first quasistationary thermonuclear fusion reaction ever.&lt;ref&gt;[[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]], 3rd edition, entry on &quot;Токамак&quot;, available online here [http://slovari.yandex.ru/art.xml?art=bse/00079/49400.htm]{{dead link|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tokamak was dramatically more efficient than the other approaches of that era, by a factor of 10 to 100 times. When they were first announced, the international community was highly skeptical. However, a British team was invited to see T-3, and after measuring it in depth they released their results that confirmed the Soviet claims. A burst of activity followed as many planned devices were abandoned and new tokamaks were introduced in their place&amp;nbsp;— the C model stellarator, then under construction after many redesigns, was quickly converted to the [[Symmetrical Tokamak]] and the stellarator was abandoned.

Through the 1970s and 80s great strides in understanding the tokamak system were made. A number of improvements to the design are now part of the &quot;advanced tokamak&quot; concept, which includes non-circular plasmas, internal diverters and limiters, often superconducting magnets, and operate in the so-called &quot;[[H-mode]]&quot; island of increased stability. Two other designs have also become fairly well studied; the compact tokamak is wired with the magnets on the inside of the vacuum chamber, while the [[spherical tokamak]] reduces its cross section as much as possible.

The tokamak dominates modern research, where very large devices like [[ITER]] are expected to pass several milestones toward commercial power production, including a [[Fusion energy gain factor|burning plasma]] with long burn times, high power output, and online fueling. There are no guarantees that the project will be successful; previous generations of tokamak machines have uncovered new problems many times. But the entire field of high temperature plasmas is much better understood now than formerly, and there is considerable optimism that ITER will meet its goals. If successful, ITER would be followed by a &quot;[[DEMO|commercial demonstrator]]&quot; system, similar in purpose to the very earliest power-producing fission reactors built in the era before wide-scale commercial deployment of larger machines started in the 1960s and 1970s.

Even if these goals are met, there are a number of major engineering problems remaining, notably finding suitable &quot;low activity&quot; materials for reactor construction, demonstrating secondary systems including practical [[tritium]] extraction, and building reactor designs that allow their reactor core to be removed when its materials becomes embrittled due to the neutron flux. Practical commercial generators based on the tokamak concept are far in the future. The public at large has been disappointed, as the initial outlook for practical fusion power plants was much rosier; a pamphlet from the 1970s printed by General Atomic stated that &quot;Several commercial fusion reactors are expected to be online by the year 2000.&quot;

===Inertial (laser) containment===
The technique of implosion of a microcapsule irradiated by [[laser]] beams, the basis of [[laser inertial confinement]], was first suggested in 1962 by scientists at [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]], shortly after the invention of the laser itself in 1960. Lasers of that era were very low powered, but low-level research using them nevertheless started as early as 1965. A great advance in the field was John Nuckolls' 1972 paper that ignition would require lasers of about 1 kJ, and efficient burn around 1 MJ. Kilo-J lasers were just beyond the state of the art at the time, and his paper sparked off a tremendous development effort to produce devices of the required power.

Early machines used a variety of approaches to attack one of two problems&amp;nbsp;— some focused on fast delivery of energy, while others were more interested in beam smoothness. Both were attempts to ensure the energy delivery would be smooth enough to cause a uniform implosion. However, these experiments demonstrated a serious problem; laser wavelengths in the [[infrared]] range of frequencies lost a tremendous amount of energy before compressing the fuel.

Important breakthroughs in laser technology were made at the [[Laboratory for Laser Energetics]] at the University of Rochester, where scientists used frequency-tripling crystals to transform the infrared laser beams into ultraviolet beams. By the late 1970s great strides had been made in laser power, but with each increase new problems were found in the implosion technique that suggested even more power would be required. By the 1980s these increases were so large that using the concept for generating net energy seemed remote.

Most research in this field turned to weapons research, always a fallback line of research, as the implosion concept is somewhat similar to [[hydrogen bomb]] operation. Work on very large versions continued as a result, with the very large [[National Ignition Facility]] in the US and [[Laser Mégajoule]] in France supporting these research programs.

More recent work has demonstrated that significant savings in the required laser energy are possible using a technique known as &quot;fast ignition&quot;. The savings are so dramatic that the concept appears to be a useful technique for energy production once again, so much so that it is a serious contender for pre-commercial development. There are proposals to build an experimental facility dedicated to the fast ignition approach, known as [[HiPER]]. At the same time, advances in [[solid state laser]]s appear to improve the &quot;driver&quot; systems' efficiency by about ten times (to 10- 20%), savings that make even the large &quot;traditional&quot; machines almost practical, and might allow the fast ignition concept to outpace the magnetic approaches in further development.

The laser-based concept has other advantages. The reactor core is mostly exposed, as opposed to being wrapped in a huge magnet as in the tokamak. This makes the problem of removing energy from the system somewhat simpler, and should mean that performing maintenance on a laser-based device would be much easier, such as core replacement. Additionally, the lack of strong magnetic fields allows for a wider variety of low-[[Neutron activation|activation]] materials, including [[carbon fiber]], which would reduce both the frequency of such neutron activations and the rate of irradiation to the core. In other ways, the program has many of the same problems as the tokamak; practical methods of energy removal and tritium recycling need to be demonstrated.

===Other approaches===
Over the years there have been a wide variety of fusion concepts. In general they fall into three groups&amp;nbsp;— those that attempt to reach high temperature/density for brief times (pinch, inertial confinement), those that operate at a steady state (magnetic confinement) or those that try neither and instead attempt to produce low quantities of fusion but do so at an extremely low cost. The latter group has largely disappeared, as the difficulties of achieving fusion have demonstrated that any low-energy device is unlikely to produce net gain. This leaves the two major approaches, magnetic and laser inertial confinement, as the leading systems for development funding. However, alternate approaches continue to be developed, and alternate non-power fusion devices have been successfully developed as well.

====Technically viable====
[[Philo T. Farnsworth]], the inventor of the first [[History of television|all-electronic television system]] in 1927, patented his first [[Fusor]] design in 1968, a device that uses [[inertial electrostatic confinement]]. This system consists largely of two concentric spherical electrical grids inside a vacuum chamber into which a small amount of fusion fuel is introduced. A voltage applied between the two grids causes the fuel to ionize around them, from which positively charged ions are accelerated towards the center of the chamber. Those ions may collide and fuse with ions coming from the other direction, may scatter without fusing, or may pass directly through.

In the latter two cases, the ions will tend to be stopped by the electric field and re-accelerated toward the center. Fusors can also use ion guns rather than electric grids.  Towards the end of the 1960s, [[Robert L. Hirsch|Robert Hirsch]] designed a variant of the Farnsworth Fusor known as the [[Hirsch-Meeks fusor]]. This variant is a considerable improvement over the Farnsworth design, and is able to generate a neutron flux in the order of one billion neutrons per second. Although the [[Energy conversion efficiency|efficiency]] was very low at first, and there were hopes the device could be scaled up, continued development demonstrated that this approach would be impractical for large machines.

Nevertheless, fusion could be achieved using a &quot;lab bench top&quot; type set up for the first time, at minimal cost. This type of fusor found its first application as a portable [[neutron generator]] in the late 1990s. An automated sealed reaction chamber version of this device, commercially named Fusionstar was developed by [[EADS]] but abandoned in 2001. Its successor is the NSD-Fusion [[neutron generator]].

[[Robert W. Bussard]]'s [[Polywell]] concept is roughly similar to that of the [[Fusor]], but replaces the problematic grid with a magnetically contained electron cloud, which holds the electrons in position and provides an accelerating potential.  The polywell consists of electromagnet coils arranged in a polyhedral configuration and positively charged to between several tens and low hundreds of kilovolts.  This charged magnetic polyhedron is called a MaGrid (Magnetic Grid).&lt;ref name=&quot;IAC2006&quot;&gt;[http://www.askmar.com/ConferenceNotes/2006-9%20IAC%20Paper.pdf  &quot;The Advent of Clean Nuclear Fusion: Super-performance Space Power and Propulsion&quot;], Robert W. Bussard, Ph.D., 57th International Astronautical Congress, October 2–6, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Electrons are introduced outside the &quot;quasi-spherical&quot; MaGrid and are accelerated into the MaGrid due to the electric field, similar to a [[magnetic bottle]]. Within the MaGrid, magnetic fields confine most of the electrons and those that escape are retained by the electric field. This configuration traps the electrons in the middle of the device, focusing them near the center to produce a virtual cathode (negative electric potential).&lt;ref name=&quot;IAC2006&quot; /&gt;

The virtual cathode accelerates and confines the ions to be fused which, except for minimal losses, never reach the physical structure of the MaGrid.  Bussard had reported a fusion rate of 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; per second running D-D fusion reactions at only 12.5 kV based on [[neutron detection|detecting]] a total of nine neutrons in five tests. Bussard claimed that a scaled-up version of 2.5–3 m in diameter, would operate at over 100 MW net power since fusion power scales as the fourth power of the B field and the cube of the size.&lt;ref name=&quot;IAC2006&quot; /&gt;

A recent&lt;ref name=&quot;IFSA2007&quot;&gt;[http://iopscience.iop.org/1742-6596/112/4/042084/pdf/jpconf8_112_042084.pdf  &quot;Status of the U. S. program in magneto-inertial fusion&quot;], Y. C. Francis Thio Ph.D., Program Manager, U. S. Department of Energy, Office of Fusion Energy Sciences, Germantown, MD,
USA&lt;/ref&gt; area of study is the [[magneto-inertial fusion]] (MIF) concept, which combines some form of external inertial compression (like lasers) with further compression through an external magnet (like pinch devices). The magnetic field traps heat within the inertial core, causing a variety of effects that improves fusion rates. These improvements are relatively minor; however, the magnetic drivers themselves are inexpensive compared to lasers or other systems. There is hope for a sweet spot that allows the combination of features from these devices to create low-density but also low-cost fusion devices. A similar concept is the [[magnetized target fusion]] device, which uses a magnetic field in an external metal shell to achieve the same basic goals.

According to [[Eric Lerner]], [[Focus fusion]] takes place in a [[dense plasma focus]],&lt;ref name=&quot;PB11&quot;&gt;[http://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/0710/0710.3149.pdf &quot;ADVANCES TOWARDS PB11 FUSION WITH THE DENSE PLASMA FOCUS&quot;], Eric Lerner, Lawrenceville Plasma Physics, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; which typically consists of two coaxial cylindrical electrodes made from copper or beryllium and housed in a vacuum chamber containing a low-pressure fusible gas. An electrical pulse is applied across the electrodes, heating the gas into a plasma. The current forms into a minuscule vortex along the axis of the machine, which then kinks into a cage of current with an associated magnetic field. The cage of current and magnetic field entrapped plasma is called a plasmoid. The acceleration of the electrons about the magnetic field lines heats the nuclei within the plasmoid to fusion temperatures. This will, in principle, yield more energy in the beams than was input to form them. A 2012 paper published in [[Physics of Plasmas]] demonstrated that Lerner's team had achieved temperatures of 1.8 billion degrees C, sufficient for boron fusion, and that fusion reactions were occurring primarily within the contained plasmoid, a necessary condition for net power.&lt;ref name=&quot;FFTemp&quot;&gt;[http://lawrencevilleplasmaphysics.com/index.php?option=com_lyftenbloggie&amp;view=entry&amp;year=2012&amp;month=03&amp;day=23&amp;id=62%3Aphysics-of-plasmas-publishes-lpps-latest-fusion-advance&amp;Itemid=90 &quot;Fusion reactions from 150 keV ions in a dense plasma focus plasmoid&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Non-power generating approaches====
A more subtle technique is to use more unusual particles to catalyse fusion. The best known of these is [[muon-catalyzed fusion]] that uses muons, which behave somewhat like electrons and replace the electrons around the atoms. These muons allow atoms to get much closer and thus reduce the kinetic energy required to initiate fusion. Muons require more energy to produce than can be obtained from muon-catalysed fusion, making this approach impractical for the generation of power.

The mass of a muon is 207 times the mass of  an electron. Muons, deuterons and tritons form &quot;heavy&quot; hydrogen molecules. Due to the increased mass, the Coulomb barrier decreases. These fusion reactions may occur at temperatures as low as room temperature and so they are also known as cold fusion reactions, but they should not be confused with Fleischmann and Pons &quot;cold fusion&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Huizenga|first=John R. |title=Cold Fusion: The Scientific Fiasco of the Century |ition=2nd |location=Oxford and New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1993 |page=112 |isbn=0-19-855817-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2005, a team from [[UCLA]] announced&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20061021025402/https://discover.com/issues/jan-06/features/physics/ The Year in Science: Physics - news education science magazines technology science news environment magazine subscriptions anthropology ecology environmental issues online mag...&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; it had devised a way of producing fusion using a machine that &quot;fits on a lab bench&quot;, using [[lithium tantalate]] to generate enough voltage to smash deuterium atoms together. However, the process does not generate net power (see [[Pyroelectric fusion]]). Such a device would be useful in the same sort of roles as the fusor.

====Unconventional approaches====
Some scientists reported excess heat, neutrons, tritium, helium and other nuclear effects in so-called [[cold fusion]] systems, which for a time gained interest as showing promise. Hopes fell when replication failures were weighed in view of several reasons cold fusion is not likely to occur, the discovery of possible sources of experimental error, and finally the discovery that Fleischmann and Pons had not actually detected nuclear reaction byproducts.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Browne|1989}}, {{harvnb|Close|1992}}, {{harvnb|Huizenga|1993}}, {{harvnb|Taubes|1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; By late 1989, most scientists considered cold fusion claims dead,&lt;ref name=&quot;Browne_1989&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Browne|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; and cold fusion subsequently gained a reputation as [[pathological science]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nytdoe&quot;&gt;

Research into [[sonoluminescence]] induced fusion, sometimes known as &quot;''[[bubble fusion]]''&quot;, also continues, although it is met with as much skepticism as cold fusion is by most of the scientific community.

==Key design areas==
===Confinement===
[[Image:IFE and MFE parameter space.svg|thumb|right|350px|Parameter space occupied by [[inertial fusion energy]] and [[magnetic fusion energy]] devices as of the mid 1990s. The regime allowing thermonuclear ignition with high gain lies near the upper right corner of the plot.]]
Confinement refers to all the conditions necessary to keep a plasma dense and hot long enough to undergo fusion:
*[[Mechanical equilibrium|Equilibrium]]: The forces acting on the plasma must be balanced so that it will not rapidly disassemble. The exception, of course, is [[inertial confinement fusion|inertial confinement]], where the relevant physics must occur faster than the disassembly time.
*[[Plasma stability|Stability]]: The plasma must be so constructed that small deviations are restored to the initial state, otherwise some unavoidable disturbance will occur and grow exponentially until the plasma is destroyed.
*Transport: The loss of particles and heat in all channels must be sufficiently slow. The word &quot;confinement&quot; is often used in the restricted sense of &quot;energy confinement&quot;.

The first human-made, large-scale fusion reaction was the test of the [[hydrogen bomb]], [[Ivy Mike]], in 1952. As part of the [[PACER (fusion)|PACER]] project, it was once proposed to use hydrogen bombs as a source of power by detonating them in underground caverns and then generating electricity from the heat produced, but such a power plant is unlikely ever to be constructed, for a variety of reasons.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} ''Controlled'' thermonuclear fusion (CTF) refers to the alternative of continuous power production, or at least the use of explosions that are so small that they do not destroy a significant portion of the machine that produces them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Atzeni|first=Stefano|title=The Physics of Inertial Fusion|year=2009|publisher=Oxford Science Publications|location=USA|isbn=978-0-19-956801-7|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To produce self-sustaining fusion, the energy released by the reaction (or at least a fraction of it) must be used to heat new reactant nuclei and keep them hot long enough that they also undergo fusion reactions. Retaining the energy is called energy confinement and may be accomplished in a number of ways, Material, Gravitational, Electrostatic, Inertial, and Magnetic Confinement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Harms|first=A|title=Principles of Fusion Energy|year=2000|publisher=World Scientific|location=USA|isbn=978-981-238-033-3|pages=47–56|url=http://www.worldscientific.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hydrogen bomb really has no confinement at all. The fuel is simply allowed to fly apart, but it takes a certain length of time for this happen, and during this time fusion can occur. This approach is called [[inertial confinement fusion|inertial confinement]]. If more than milligram quantities of fuel are used (and efficiently fused), the explosion would destroy the machine, so theoretically, controlled thermonuclear fusion using inertial confinement would be done using tiny pellets of fuel which explode several times a second.

To induce the explosion, the pellet must be compressed to about 30 times solid density with energetic beams. If the beams are focused directly on the pellet, it is called direct drive, which can in principle be very efficient, but in practice it is difficult to obtain the needed uniformity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pfalzner|first=Susanne|title=An Introduction to Inertial Confinement Fusion|year=2006|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|location=USA|isbn=0-7503-0701-3|pages=19–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative approach is indirect drive, in which the beams heat a shell, and the shell radiates [[x-rays]], which then implode the pellet. The beams are commonly laser beams, but heavy and light [[ion beam]]s and electron beams have all been investigated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pfalzner|first=Susanne|title=An Introduction to Inertial Confinement Fusion|year=2006|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|location=USA|isbn=0-7503-0701-3|pages=182–193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inertial confinement produces plasmas with impressively high densities and temperatures, and appears to be best suited to weapons research, [[X-ray generation]], very small reactors, and perhaps in the distant future, spaceflight.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} They require fuel pellets with close to a perfect shape in order to generate a symmetrical inward [[shock wave]] to produce the high-density plasma, and in practice these have proven difficult to produce.

A recent development in the field of laser induced ICF is the use of ultrashort pulse multi-[[petawatt]] lasers to heat the plasma of an imploding pellet at exactly the moment of greatest density after it is imploded conventionally using terawatt scale lasers. This research will be carried out on the (currently being built) OMEGA EP petawatt and [[LLE|OMEGA]] lasers at the [[University of Rochester]] and at the GEKKO XII laser at the institute for laser engineering in Osaka Japan, which if fruitful, may have the effect of greatly reducing the cost of a laser fusion based power source.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

At the temperatures required for fusion, the fuel is in the form of a plasma with very good [[electrical conductivity]]. This opens the possibility to confine the fuel and the energy with [[magnetic field]]s, an idea known as [[magnetic fusion energy|magnetic confinement]]. The [[Lorenz force]] works only perpendicular to the magnetic field, so that the first problem is how to prevent the plasma from leaking out the ends of the field lines. There are basically two solutions.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

The first is to use the [[magnetic mirror]] effect. If particles following a field line encounter a region of higher field strength, then some of the particles will be stopped and reflected. Advantages of a magnetic mirror power plant would be simplified construction and maintenance due to a linear topology and the potential to apply direct conversion in a natural way, but the confinement achieved in the experiments was so poor that this approach has been essentially abandoned.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

The second possibility to prevent end losses is to bend the field lines back on themselves, either in circles or more commonly in nested [[torus|toroidal]] surfaces. The most highly developed system of this type is the ''[[tokamak]]'', with the ''[[stellarator]]'' being next most advanced, followed by the [[Reversed field pinch]]. Compact toroids, especially the ''[[Field-Reversed Configuration]]'' and the [[spheromak]], attempt to combine the advantages of toroidal magnetic surfaces with those of a [[simply connected space|simply connected]] (non-toroidal) machine, resulting in a mechanically simpler and smaller confinement area. Compact toroids still have some enthusiastic supporters but are not backed as readily by the majority of the fusion community.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

Finally, there are also ''[[Inertial electrostatic confinement|electrostatic confinement fusion]]'' systems, in which [[ion]]s in the reaction chamber are confined and held at the center of the device by electrostatic forces, as in the [[Farnsworth-Hirsch Fusor]] (which is not believed to be able to be developed into a power plant). The [[Polywell]], an advanced variant of the [[fusor]],{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} has shown a degree of research interest as of late; however, the technology is relatively immature,{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} and major scientific and engineering questions remain which researchers under the auspices of the U.S. [[Office of Naval Research]] hope to further investigate.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

===Materials===
{{Main|International Fusion Materials Irradiation Facility}}
Developing materials for fusion reactors has long been recognized as a problem nearly as difficult and important as that of plasma confinement, but it has received only a fraction of the attention. The neutron flux in a fusion reactor is expected to be about 100 times that in existing [[pressurized water reactor]]s (PWR). Each atom in the blanket of a fusion reactor is expected to be hit by a neutron and displaced about a hundred times before the material is replaced. Furthermore the high-energy neutrons will produce hydrogen and helium by way of various nuclear reactions that tends to form bubbles at grain boundaries and result in swelling, blistering or embrittlement. There is also a need for materials whose primary components and impurities do not result in long-lived radioactive wastes. Finally, the mechanical forces and temperatures are large, and there may be frequent cycling of both.

The problem is exacerbated because realistic material tests must expose samples to neutron fluxes of a similar level for a similar length of time as those expected in a fusion power plant. Such a neutron source is nearly as complicated and expensive as a fusion reactor itself would be. Proper materials testing will not be possible in [[ITER]], and a proposed materials testing facility, [[IFMIF]], was still at the design stage as of 2005.

The material of the plasma facing components (PFC) is a special problem. The PFC do not have to withstand large mechanical loads, so neutron damage is much less of an issue. They do have to withstand large thermal loads, up to 10&amp;nbsp;MW/m², which is a difficult but solvable problem. Regardless of the material chosen, the heat flux can only be accommodated without melting if the distance from the front surface to the coolant is not more than a centimeter or two. The primary issue is the interaction with the plasma. One can choose either a low-[[Atomic number|Z]] material, such as [[graphite]] or [[beryllium]], or a high-[[Atomic number|Z]] material, usually [[tungsten]] with [[molybdenum]] as a second choice. Use of liquid metals (lithium, gallium, tin) has also been proposed, e.g., by injection of 1–5&amp;nbsp;mm thick streams flowing at 10&amp;nbsp;m/s on solid substrates.

If graphite is used, the gross erosion rates due to physical and chemical [[sputtering]] would be many meters per year, so one must rely on redeposition of the sputtered material. The location of the redeposition will not exactly coincide with the location of the sputtering, so one is still left with erosion rates that may be prohibitive. An even larger problem is the tritium co-deposited with the redeposited graphite. The tritium inventory in graphite layers and dust in a reactor could quickly build up to many kilograms, representing a waste of resources and a serious radiological hazard in case of an accident. The consensus of the fusion community seems to be that graphite, although a very attractive material for fusion experiments, cannot be the primary PFC material in a commercial reactor.

The sputtering rate of tungsten by the plasma fuel ions is orders of magnitude smaller than that of carbon, and tritium is much less incorporated into redeposited tungsten, making this a more attractive choice. On the other hand, tungsten impurities in a plasma are much more damaging than carbon impurities, and self-sputtering of tungsten can be high, so it will be necessary to ensure that the plasma in contact with the tungsten is not too hot (a few tens of eV rather than hundreds of eV). Tungsten also has disadvantages in terms of eddy currents and melting in off-normal events, as well as some radiological issues.

===Subsystems===
In fusion research, achieving a [[fusion energy gain factor]] ''Q'' = 1 is called breakeven and is considered a significant although somewhat artificial milestone. Ignition refers to an infinite ''Q'', that is, a self-sustaining plasma where the losses are made up for by fusion power without any external input. In a practical fusion reactor, some external power will always be required for things like current drive, refueling, profile control, and burn control. A value on the order of ''Q'' = 20 will be required if the plant is to deliver much more energy than it uses internally.

Despite many differences between possible designs of power plant, there are several systems that are common to most. A fusion power plant, like a [[nuclear power|fission power plant]], is customarily divided into the nuclear island and the balance of plant. The balance of plant converts heat into electricity via [[steam turbine]]s; it is a conventional design area and in principle similar to any other power station that relies on heat generation, whether fusion, fission or [[fossil fuel]] based.

The [[nuclear island]] has a plasma chamber with an associated vacuum system, surrounded by [[plasma-facing components]] ([[first wall]] and [[divertor]]) maintaining the vacuum boundary and absorbing the thermal radiation coming from the plasma, surrounded in turn by a [[blanket (disambiguation)|blanket]] where the neutrons are absorbed to breed tritium and heat a working fluid that transfers the power to the balance of plant. If magnetic confinement is used, a magnet system, using primarily cryogenic superconducting magnets, is needed, and usually systems for heating and refueling the plasma and for driving current. In inertial confinement, a driver (laser or accelerator) and a focusing system are needed, as well as a means for forming and positioning the pellets.

[[Image:Fusion target implosion on NOVA laser.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Inertial confinement fusion implosion on the [[Nova laser]] creates &quot;microsun&quot; conditions of tremendously high density and temperature.]]
Although the standard solution for electricity production in fusion power plant designs is conventional steam turbines using the heat deposited by neutrons, there are also designs for direct conversion of the energy of the charged particles into electricity. These are of little value with a D-T fuel cycle, where 80% of the power is in the neutrons, but are indispensable with [[aneutronic fusion]], where less than 1% is. Direct conversion has been most commonly proposed for open-ended magnetic configurations like [[magnetic mirror]]s or [[Field-Reversed Configuration]]s, where charged particles are lost along the magnetic field lines, which are then expanded to convert a large fraction of the random energy of the fusion products into directed motion. The particles are then collected on electrodes at various large electrical potentials. Typically the claimed conversion efficiency is in the range of 80%, but the converter may approach the reactor itself in size and expense.

==Safety and the environment==
===Accident potential===
There is no possibility of a ''catastrophic'' accident in a fusion reactor resulting in major release of radioactivity to the environment or injury to non-staff, unlike modern fission reactors. The primary reason is that nuclear fusion requires precisely controlled temperature, pressure, and magnetic field parameters to generate net energy. If the reactor were damaged, these parameters would be disrupted and the heat generation in the reactor would rapidly cease.&lt;ref name=afraid&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.iter.org/newsline/107/1489 |title= Who is afraid of ITER? |first= Krista|last=Dulon |work=iter.org |year=2012 [last update] |accessdate=18 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fusion reactors are extremely safe in this sense, and it makes them favorable over fission reactors, which, in contrast, continue to generate heat through [[beta-decay]] for several months after reactor shut-down, meaning that melting of fuel rods is possible even after the reactor has been stopped due to continued accumulation of heat.&lt;ref name=&quot;McCrackenStott2012&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=McCracken|first1=Garry |last2=Stott|first2=Peter |title=Fusion: The Energy of the Universe|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=e6jEZfO2gO4C&amp;pg=PA198|accessdate=18 August 2012|date=8 June 2012|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-12-384656-3|pages=198-199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also no risk of a runaway reaction in a fusion reactor, since the [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] is normally burnt at optimal conditions, and any significant change will render it unable to produce excess heat. In fusion reactors the reaction process is so delicate that this level of safety is inherent; no elaborate failsafe mechanism is required.  Although the plasma in a fusion power plant will have a volume of 1000 cubic meters or more, the density of the plasma is extremely low, and the total amount of fusion fuel in the vessel is very small, typically a few grams.&lt;ref name=&quot;McCrackenStott2012&quot;/&gt; If the fuel supply is closed, the reaction stops within seconds. In comparison, a fission reactor is typically loaded with enough fuel for several years, and no additional fuel is necessary to keep the reaction going.&lt;ref name=&quot;Angelo2004&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Angelo|first=Joseph A. |title=Nuclear Technology|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ITfaP-xY3LsC&amp;pg=PA474|accessdate=18 August 2012|date=30 November 2004|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-1-57356-336-9|page=474}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the magnetic approach, strong fields are developed in coils that are held in place mechanically by the reactor structure. Failure of this structure could release this tension and allow the magnet to &quot;explode&quot; outward. The severity of this event would be similar to any other industrial accident or an [[MRI]] machine [http://www.indyrad.iupui.edu/RadWeb/Portals/0/ContentFiles/Education/Training/MR_Safety_files/frame.htm quench]/explosion, and could be effectively stopped with a [[containment building]] similar to those used in existing (fission) nuclear generators. The laser-driven inertial approach is generally lower-stress. Although failure of the reaction chamber is possible, simply stopping fuel delivery would prevent any sort of catastrophic failure.

Most reactor designs rely on the use of liquid [[lithium]] as both a coolant and a method for converting stray neutrons from the reaction into [[tritium]], which is fed back into the reactor as fuel. Lithium is highly flammable, and in the case of a fire it is possible that the lithium stored on-site could be burned up and escape. In this case the tritium contents of the lithium would be released into the atmosphere, posing a radiation risk. However, calculations suggest that at about 1&amp;nbsp;kg the total amount of tritium and other radioactive gases in a typical power plant would be so small that they would have diluted to legally acceptable limits by the time they blew as far as the plant's [[perimeter fence]].&lt;ref name=&quot;WorldEnergyCouncil&quot;/&gt;

The likelihood of ''small industrial'' accidents including the local release of radioactivity and injury to staff cannot be estimated yet. These would include accidental releases of lithium, tritium, or mis-handling of decommissioned radioactive components of the reactor itself.

===Effluents during normal operation===
The natural product of the fusion reaction is a small amount of [[helium]], which is completely harmless to life.  Of more concern is [[tritium]], which, like other isotopes of hydrogen, is difficult to retain completely. During normal operation, some amount of tritium will be continually released. There would be no acute danger, but the cumulative effect on the world's population from a fusion economy could be a matter of concern.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

Although tritium is volatile and biologically active, the health risk posed by a release is much lower than that of most radioactive contaminants, due to tritium's short half-life (12 years), very low decay energy (~14.95 keV), and the fact that it does not [[bioaccumulation|bioaccumulate]] (instead being cycled out of the body as water, with a [[biological half-life]] of 7 to 14 days).&lt;ref name=&quot;nuclearsafety-petrangeli&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Nuclear Safety |last=Petrangeli |first=Gianni |year=2006 |publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann |isbn=978-0-7506-6723-4 |page=430 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Current ITER designs are investigating total containment facilities for any tritium.

===Waste management===
The large flux of high-energy neutrons in a reactor will make the structural materials radioactive. The radioactive inventory at shut-down may be comparable to that of a fission reactor, but there are important differences.

The half-life of the [[radioisotopes]] produced by fusion tend to be less than those from fission, so that the inventory decreases more rapidly. Unlike fission reactors, whose waste remains radioactive for thousands of years, most of the radioactive material in a fusion reactor would be the reactor core itself, which would be dangerous for about 50 years, and low-level waste another 100.  Although this waste will be considerably more radioactive during those 50 years than fission waste, the very short half-life makes the process very attractive, as the waste management is fairly straightforward.  By 300 years the material would have the same radioactivity as [[coal ash]].&lt;ref name=&quot;WorldEnergyCouncil&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, the choice of materials used in a fusion reactor is less constrained than in a fission design, where many materials are required for their specific [[neutron cross-section]]s. This allows a fusion reactor to be designed using materials that are selected specifically to be &quot;low activation&quot;, materials that do not easily become radioactive. [[Vanadium]], for example, would become much less radioactive than [[stainless steel]]. [[Carbon fiber]] materials are also low-activation, as well as being strong and light, and are a promising area of study for laser-inertial reactors where a magnetic field is not required.

In general terms, fusion reactors would create far less radioactive material than a fission reactor, the material it would create is less damaging biologically, and the radioactivity &quot;burns off&quot; within a time period that is well within existing engineering capabilities.

===Nuclear proliferation===
Although fusion power uses nuclear technology, the overlap with nuclear weapons technology is small. [[Tritium]] is a component of the trigger of [[hydrogen bomb]]s, but not a major problem in production. The copious neutrons from a fusion reactor could be used to breed [[plutonium]] for an atomic bomb, but not without extensive redesign of the reactor, so that production would be difficult to conceal. The theoretical and computational tools needed for hydrogen bomb design are closely related to those needed for [[inertial confinement fusion]], but have very little in common with the more scientifically developed [[magnetic confinement fusion]].

===As a sustainable energy source===
Large-scale reactors using neutronic fuels (e.g. [[ITER]]) and thermal power production (turbine based) are most comparable to [[nuclear power|fission power]] from an engineering and economics viewpoint. Both fission and fusion power plants involve a relatively compact heat source powering a conventional steam turbine-based power plant, while producing enough neutron radiation to make [[neutron activation|activation]] of the plant materials problematic. The main distinction is that fusion power produces no high-level radioactive waste (though activated plant materials still need to be disposed of). There are some power plant ideas which may significantly lower the cost or size of such plants; however, research in these areas is nowhere near as advanced as in [[tokamak]]s.

Fusion power commonly proposes the use of [[deuterium]], an [[isotope]] of hydrogen, as fuel and in many current designs also use [[lithium]]. Assuming a fusion energy output equal to the 1995 global power output of about 100 [[exa-|E]]J/yr (= 1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt; J/yr) and that this does not increase in the future, then the known current lithium reserves would last 3000 years, lithium from sea water would last 60 million years, and a more complicated fusion process using only deuterium from sea water would have fuel for 150 billion years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agci.org/dB/PDFs/03S2_MMauel_SafeFusion%3F.pdf Energy for Future Centuries]&lt;/ref&gt; To put this in context, 150 billion years is close to 30 times the remaining lifespan of the sun,&lt;ref name=&quot;sunlife&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://helios.gsfc.nasa.gov/qa_sun.html#sunlife|title=Cosmicopia|last=Dr. Eric Christian, Et al.|publisher=NASA|accessdate=2009-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and more than 10 times the estimated age of the universe.

==Economics==
While fusion power is still in early stages of development, substantial sums have been and continue to be invested in research. In the EU almost {{nowrap|€10 billion}} was spent on fusion research up to the end of the 1990s, and the new [[ITER]] reactor alone is budgeted at {{nowrap|€10 billion}}. It is estimated that up to the point of possible implementation of electricity generation by nuclear fusion, R&amp;D will need further promotion totalling around {{nowrap|€60-80 billion}} over a period of {{nowrap|50 years}} or so (of which {{nowrap|€20-30 billion}} within the EU) based on a report from 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=The current EU research programme | url=http://www.tab.fzk.de/en/projekt/zusammenfassung/ab75.htm | work=[[Sixth Framework Programme|FP6]] | publisher= | date= | accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nuclear fusion research receives {{nowrap|€750 million}} (excluding ITER funding), compared with {{nowrap|€810 million}} for all non-nuclear energy research combined,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=The Sixth Framework Programme in brief | url=http://ec.europa.eu/research/fp6/pdf/fp6-in-brief_en.pdf | work= | publisher= | date= | accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; putting research into fusion power well ahead of that of any single rivaling technology.

==Advantages==
Fusion power would provide much more energy for a given weight of fuel than any technology currently in use,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Despite being technically [[non-renewable energy|non-renewable]], fusion power has many of the benefits of renewable energy sources (such as being a long-term energy supply and emitting no [[greenhouse gas]]es) as well as some of the benefits of the resource-limited energy sources as hydrocarbons and nuclear fission (without [[Nuclear reprocessing|reprocessing]]). Like these currently dominant energy sources, fusion could provide very high power-generation density and uninterrupted power delivery (due to the fact that it is not dependent on the [[weather]], unlike wind and solar power).

Another aspect of fusion energy is that the cost of production does not suffer from [[diseconomies of scale]]. The cost of water and wind energy, for example, goes up as the optimal locations are developed first, while further generators must be sited in less ideal conditions. With fusion energy, the production cost will not increase much, even if large numbers of plants are built, because the sites of plants are not resources.

Some problems which are expected to be an issue in this century such as [[water resources|fresh water shortages]] can alternatively be regarded as problems of energy supply. For example, in [[desalination]] plants, [[seawater]] can be purified through [[distillation]] or [[reverse osmosis]]. However, these processes are energy intensive. Even if the first fusion plants are not competitive with alternative sources, fusion could still become competitive if large-scale desalination requires more power than the alternatives are able to provide.

A scenario has been presented of the effect of the commercialization of fusion power on the future of human civilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.plasmafocus.net/IPFS/2010%20Papers/LSmankind.pdf|title=Nuclear Fusion Energy-Mankind's Giant Step Forward|author=Sing Lee and Sor Heoh Saw}}&lt;/ref&gt; ITER and later Demo are envisioned to bring online the first commercial nuclear fusion energy reactor by 2050. Using this as the starting point and the history of the uptake of nuclear fission reactors as a guide, the scenario depicts a rapid take up of nuclear fusion energy starting after the middle of this century.

==Current status==

{{out of date|date=October 2011}}

Despite optimism dating back to the 1950s about the wide-scale harnessing of fusion power, there are still significant barriers standing between current scientific understanding and technological capabilities and the practical realization of fusion as an energy source.  Research, while making steady progress, has also continually thrown up new difficulties.  Therefore it remains unclear whether an economically viable fusion plant is possible.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=fusions-false-dawn Fusion’s False Dawn] by Michael Moyer ''[[Scientific American]]'' March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;newscientist&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newscientist.com/channel/opinion/mg19025543.300-editorial-nuclear-fusion-must-be-worth-the-gamble.html |title=Editorial: Nuclear fusion must be worth the gamble |publisher=''[[New Scientist]]'' |date=7 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2006 editorial in ''[[New Scientist]]'' magazine opined that &quot;if commercial fusion is viable, it may well be a century away.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;newscientist&quot; /&gt;

Several fusion D-T burning tokamak test devices have been built ([[TFTR]], [[Joint European Torus|JET]]); it was hoped that TFTR would be able to produce more thermal energy than electrical energy consumed but this was not achieved. The [[ITER]] project is currently leading the effort to commercialize fusion power.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

A paper published in January 2009 and part of the IAEA Fusion Conference Proceedings at Geneva last October claims that small 50 MW Tokamak style reactors are feasible.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.claverton-energy.com/physics-and-engineering-basis-of-multi-functional-compact-tokamak.html physics and engineering basis of multi-functional compact tokamak ]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, a high-energy laser system, the [[National Ignition Facility]], was created in the US, which can heat hydrogen atoms to temperatures only existing in nature in the cores of stars.  The new laser is expected to have the ability to produce, for the first time, more energy from controlled, inertially confined nuclear fusion than was required to initiate the reaction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20101224224354/http://www.breitbart.com/article.php?id=CNG.12fab6f6c00a65e15e6fb5e305aacbb7.41&amp;show_article=1 &quot;US lab debuts super laser&quot;, Breitbart news site]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!---
On 28 January 2010, the LLNL announced tests using all 192 laser beams, although with lower laser energies, smaller [[hohlraum]] targets, and substitutes for the fusion fuel capsules.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8485669.stm|title=Laser fusion test results raise energy hopes|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2010-01-29 | date=January 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publicaffairs.llnl.gov/news/news_releases/2010/NR-10-01-06.html|title=Initial NIF experiments meet requirements for fusion ignition|publisher=Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory|accessdate=2010-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than one megajoule of ultraviolet energy was fired into the hohlraum, beating the previous world record by a factor of more than 30. The results gave the scientists confidence that they will be able to achieve ignition in more realistic tests scheduled to begin in the summer of 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8485669.stm &quot;BBC:Laser fusion test results raise energy hopes&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, NIF researchers were conducting a series of &quot;tuning&quot; shots to determine the optimal target design and laser parameters for high-energy ignition experiments with fusion fuel in the following months.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.llnl.gov/news/newsreleases/2010/Nov/NR-10-11-02.html World's largest laser sets records for neutron yield and laser energy&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Two firing tests were performed on 31 October 2010 and 2 November 2010. In early 2012, NIF director Mike Dunne expected the laser system to generate fusion with net energy gain by the end of 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://optics.org/news/3/1/37 PW 2012: fusion laser on track for 2012 burn&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!---On 15 March 2012, the NIF's array of 192 lasers fired a shaped pulse of energy that generated 411 trillion watts of peak power - 1,000 times more than whole of the United States uses at any one moment.

The '''Jìn Dynasty''' ({{zh|s=晋朝|t=晉朝|p=Jìn Cháo|w=Chin⁴-ch'ao²}}, {{IPA-cmn|tɕîn tʂʰɑ̌ʊ|IPA}};), was a dynasty in Chinese history, lasting between the years 265 and 420 [[Common Era|CE]]. There are two main divisions in the history of the Dynasty, the first being '''Western Jin''' ([[Chinese language|ch]]: 西晉, 265–316) and the second '''Eastern Jin''' (ch: 東晉 317–420). Western Jin was founded by [[Emperor Wu of Jin|Sima Yan]], with its capital at [[Luoyang]], while Eastern Jin was begun by [[Emperor Yuan of Jin|Sima Rui]], with its capital at [[Jiankang]]. The two periods are also known as '''Liang Jin''' (ch: 兩晉 lit, two Jin) and '''Sima Jin''' by scholars, to distinguish this dynasty from other dynasties that use the same Chinese character, such as the [[Later Jin Dynasty (Five Dynasties)|Later Jin Dynasty]] (ch: 後晉).

==Foundation==
The [[Sima (surname)|Sima]] clan was initially subordinate to the [[Cao Wei|Wei]] dynasty, but the clan's influence and power grew greatly after the [[Incident at Gaoping Tombs|incident at Gaoping tombs]] in 249. In 265, Sima Yan forced emperor [[Cao Huan]] of Wei to abdicate the throne to him, ending Wei and starting Jin (as Emperor Wu). He named his dynasty after the [[Jin (Chinese state)|state of Jin]] of the [[Spring and Autumn Period]] that once ruled the Sima clan's home county of Wen in Henei (present day [[Wen County, Henan]]). In 280, the Jin conquered [[Eastern Wu]] and unified China, but internal conflicts, corruption, and political turmoil quickly weakened the dynasty, and the unification lasted only ten years. Upon the advent of the second Jin emperor, Emperor Hui, various imperial princes tried to grab power in the devastating [[War of the Eight Princes]]. The [[Wu Hu uprising]] followed, during which large numbers of refugees fled south while the north was occupied by various nomadic groups. This marked the end of the Western Jin dynasty in 316 when the Jin court evacuated to the region south of the [[Huai River]], and the beginning of the Eastern Jin and the [[Sixteen Kingdoms]] period. 

Sima Rui founded the Eastern Jin at Jiankang in 317, with its territory stretching across most of today's southern China. The combination of the Eastern Jin and Sixteen Kingdoms period is sometimes called the '''Eastern Jin Sixteen Kingdoms''' (ch: 東晉十六國). During this period, huge numbers of people moved south from the [[Central Plain (China)|central plain]], stimulating the development of Southern China. The Emperors of Eastern Jin had limited power, with most of it concentrated in the royal family's hands, whilst military power was mostly wielded by non-royals. Many fangzhen (ch:[http://zh.wikipedia.org/zh/%E6%96%B9%E9%95%87 方鎮] lit. military county) started to have ambitions which resulted in military revolts, like the rebellions of [[Wang Dun]], [[Su Jun]], and the dictatorship of [[Huan Wen]]. Even though there was the stated goal of getting back the &quot;northern lost lands&quot;, paranoia within the royal family and a constant string of disruptions to the throne caused the loss of support of many officials. In 383, [[Former Qin]] mobilized its troops and intended to conquer Eastern Jin. Faced by the threat of invasion, many Jin officials cooperated hoping to repel the attack. After the [[Battle of Fei River|battle of Fei river]], [[Xie An]], [[Xie Xuan]], and other generals were able to push back the Qin's assault and seized back  a huge amount of territory from their enemy. However, more internal political battles from different groups of officials followed [[Huan Xuan]]'s usurpation of the throne. As civilian administration suffered, more revolts from [http://zh.wikipedia.org/zh/%E5%AD%AB%E6%81%A9 Sun En], [http://zh.wikipedia.org/zh/%E5%8D%A2%E5%BE%AA Lu Xun], and the declaration of a new kingdom called [[Western Shu]] by the militarist Qiao zong in Eastern Jin's [[Sichuan|Shu region]]. Ultimately, [[Liu Yu]]'s rise ended major chaos and later he took the throne for himself, marking the ending of the Jin Dynasty and the start of the [[Liu Song Dynasty]], and the  [[Southern and Northern Dynasties]] period of Chinese history.

==History==
{{Main|History of the Jin Dynasty (265-420)}}
[[Image:JinJar.JPG|thumb|upright|''[[Hunping]]'' jar of the Western Jìn, with [[Buddhist]] figures.]]
The '''Western Jìn Dynasty''' ([[Chinese language|ch]]: 西晉, 265–316) was founded by [[Emperor Wu of Jin|Emperor Wu]], better known as Sima Yan. Although it provided a brief period of unity after conquering [[Eastern Wu]] in 280, the Jìn suffered a devastating civil war, [[War of the Eight Princes]], after which they could not contain the revolt of nomadic tribes known as the [[Wu Hu]]. The capital, [[Luoyang]] was captured in 311, and [[Emperor Huai of Jin China|Emperor Huai]] was captured. His successor, [[Emperor Min of Jin China|Emperor Min]] was also captured in [[Chang'an]] in 316.

The remnants of the Jìn court fled to the east and reestablished the government at [[Jiankang]], near modern-day [[Nanjing]], under a member of the royal family named the Prince of Langye. The prince was proclaimed [[Emperor Yuan of Jin China|Emperor Yuan]] of the '''Eastern Jìn Dynasty''' (ch: 東晉 317–420) when news of the fall of Chang'an reached the south. (The rival [[Wu Hu]] states in the north, which did not recognize the legitimacy of Jin, would sometimes refer to it as &quot;Langye.&quot;)

[[Image:China400ce.png|thumb|Eastern Jin c. 400 CE]]

Military crises, such as the rebellions of generals [[Wang Dun]] and [[Su Jun]], plagued the Eastern Jìn throughout its 104 years of existence.  However, the [[Battle of Fei River]] turned out to be a major Jìn victory, due to the short-lived cooperation of [[Huan Chong]], brother of a great general [[Huan Wen]], and Prime Minister [[Xie An]]. Later, [[Huan Xuan]], son of [[Huan Wen]], usurped the throne and changed the dynasty's name to [[Huan Chu|Chu]]. He, in turn, was toppled by [[Emperor Wu of Liu Song|Liu Yu]], who after reinstating [[Emperor An of Jin China|Emperor An]], ordered him strangled and installed his brother, [[Emperor Gong of Jin China|Emperor Gong]], in 419. 

Emperor Gong abdicated in 420 in favor of Liu Yu, ushering in the [[Liu Song Dynasty]] the first of the [[Southern Dynasties]]. The Jin Dynasty thus came to an end.  

Meanwhile, North China was ruled by the [[Sixteen Kingdoms]], many of which were founded by the [[Wu Hu]]. The last of these, [[Northern Liang]], was conquered by the [[Northern Wei Dynasty]] in 439, ushering in the [[Northern Dynasties]] period.

The Jin Dynasty is well known for the quality of its greenish [[celadon]] porcelain wares, which immediately followed the development of [[proto-celadon]]. Jar designs often incorporated animal, as well as Buddhist, figures.&lt;ref&gt;[[Shanghai Museum]] permanent exhibit&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of [[Yue ware]] are also known from the Jin Dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;[[Guimet Museum]] permanent exhibit&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:DESPREZ.jpg|thumb|right|1611 [[woodcut]] of Josquin des Prez, copied from a now-lost oil painting done during his lifetime&lt;ref&gt;Macey et al., §8.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

'''Josquin des Prez [Josquin Lebloitte dit Desprez]''' ({{IPA-fr|ʒɔskɛ̃ depʁe}}; c. 1450/1455 &amp;ndash; 27 August 1521), often referred to simply as '''Josquin''', was a [[Franco-Flemish School|Franco-Flemish]] composer of the [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]]. He is also known as '''Josquin Desprez''' and Latinized as '''Josquinus Pratensis''', alternatively '''Jodocus Pratensis''', although he himself expressed his preferred spelling of his name, Josquin des Prez, in an [[acrostic]] in his motet ''Illibata Dei virgo nutrix''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.cpdl.org/wiki/index.php/Illibata_Dei_Virgo_nutrix_(Josquin_des_Prez) ChoralWiki ''Illibata Dei virgo nutrix'' (Josquin des Prez)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clutterham.&lt;/ref&gt; He was the most famous European composer between [[Guillaume Dufay]] and [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina|Palestrina]], and is usually considered to be the central figure of the Franco-Flemish School. Josquin is widely considered by music scholars to be the first master of the high [[Renaissance]] style of [[polyphony|polyphonic]] vocal music that was emerging during his lifetime.

During the 16th century, Josquin gradually acquired the reputation as the greatest composer of the age, his mastery of technique and expression universally imitated and admired. Writers as diverse as [[Baldassare Castiglione]] and [[Martin Luther]] wrote about his reputation and fame; theorists such as [[Heinrich Glarean]] and [[Gioseffo Zarlino]] held his style as that best representing perfection.&lt;ref&gt;Wegman, p.&amp;nbsp;21–25.&lt;/ref&gt; He was so admired that many anonymous compositions were attributed to him by copyists, probably to increase their sales.&lt;ref&gt;Reese, Grove.&lt;/ref&gt; More than 370 works are attributed to him;&lt;ref&gt;Wegman, p.&amp;nbsp;28.&lt;/ref&gt; it was only after the advent of modern analytical scholarship that some of these mistaken attributions have been challenged, on the basis of stylistic features and manuscript evidence. Yet in spite of Josquin's colossal reputation, which endured until the beginning of the [[Baroque music|Baroque]] era and was revived in the 20th century, his biography is shadowy, and we know next to nothing about his personality. The only surviving work which may be in his own hand is a graffito on the wall of the [[Sistine Chapel]], and only one contemporary mention of his character is known, in a letter to [[Ercole d'Este I|Duke Ercole I]] of [[Ferrara]]. The lives of dozens of minor composers of the Renaissance are better documented than the life of Josquin.&lt;ref&gt;Wegman, pp.&amp;nbsp;21–22.&lt;/ref&gt;

Josquin wrote both [[religious music|sacred]] and [[Secularity|secular]] music, and in all of the significant vocal forms of the age, including [[mass (music)|masses]], [[motet]]s, [[chanson]]s and [[frottola|frottole]]. During the 16th century, he was praised for both his supreme [[melody|melodic]] gift and his use of ingenious technical devices. In modern times, scholars have attempted to ascertain the basic details of his biography, and have tried to define the key characteristics of his style to correct misattributions, a task that has proved difficult, as Josquin liked to solve compositional problems in different ways in successive compositions—sometimes he wrote in an austere style devoid of ornamentation, and at other times he wrote music requiring considerable virtuosity.&lt;ref&gt;Sherr, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Heinrich Glarean]] wrote in 1547 that Josquin was not only a &quot;magnificent virtuoso&quot; (the Latin can be translated also as &quot;show-off&quot;) but capable of being a &quot;mocker&quot;, using [[satire]] effectively.&lt;ref&gt;Glareanus, quoted in Sherr, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; While the focus of scholarship in recent years has been to remove music from the &quot;Josquin canon&quot; (including some of his most famous pieces) and to reattribute it to his contemporaries, the remaining music represents some of the most famous and enduring of the Renaissance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sherr_10&quot;&gt;Sherr, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==

===Birth and early career===
Little is known for certain of Josquin's early life. Much is inferential and speculative, though numerous clues have emerged from his works and the writings of contemporary composers, theorists, and writers of the next several generations. Josquin was born in the area controlled by the [[Duke of Burgundy|Dukes of Burgundy]], and was possibly born either in [[County of Hainaut|Hainaut]] (modern-day [[Belgium]]), or immediately across the border in modern-day France, since several times in his life he was classified legally as a Frenchman (for instance, when he made his will). Josquin was long mistaken for a man with a similar name, Josquin de Kessalia, born around the year 1440, who sang in [[Milan]] from 1459 to 1474, dying in 1498. More recent scholarship has shown that Josquin des Prez was born around 1450 or a few years later, and did not go to Italy until the early 1480s.

Around 1466, perhaps on the death of his father, Josquin was named by his uncle and aunt, Gilles Lebloitte dit Desprez and Jacque Banestonne, as their heir. Their will gives Josquin's actual surname as Lebloitte. According to Matthews and Merkley, &quot;des Prez&quot; was a nickname.&lt;ref&gt;Matthews and Merkley, {{Page needed|date=May 2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to an account by Claude Hémeré, a friend and librarian of [[Cardinal Richelieu]] whose evidence dates as late as 1633, and who used the records of the collegiate church of [[Saint-Quentin, Aisne|Saint-Quentin]],&lt;ref&gt;Reese et al., {{Page needed|date=May 2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Josquin became a choirboy at Saint-Quentin, probably around 1460, and was in charge of its music. Doubt has been cast on the accuracy of Hémeré's account, however.&lt;ref name=&quot;Macey1&quot;&gt;Macey et al., §1.&lt;/ref&gt; He may have studied [[counterpoint]] under [[Johannes Ockeghem|Ockeghem]], whom he greatly admired throughout his life: this is suggested both by the testimony of [[Gioseffo Zarlino]] and [[Lodovico Zacconi]], writing later in the 16th century, and by Josquin's eloquent lament on the death of Ockeghem in 1497, ''[[Nymphes des bois|Nymphes des bois/Requiem aeternam]]'', based on the poem by [[Jean Molinet]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Macey1&quot;/&gt; All records from Saint-Quentin were destroyed in 1669; however the cathedral there was a center of music-making for the entire area, and in addition was an important center of royal patronage. Both [[Jean Mouton]] and [[Loyset Compère]] were buried there, and it is certainly possible that Josquin acquired his later connections with the French royal chapel through early experiences at Saint-Quentin.

The first definite record of his employment is dated 19 April 1477, and it shows that he was a singer at the chapel of [[René of Anjou|René, Duke of Anjou]], in [[Aix-en-Provence]]. He remained there at least until 1478. No certain records of his movements exist for the period from March 1478 until 1483, but if he remained in the employ of René he would have transferred to Paris in 1481 along with the rest of the chapel. One of Josquin's early motets, ''Misericordias Domini in aeternum cantabo'', suggests a direct connection with [[Louis XI of France|Louis XI]], who was king during this time. In 1483 Josquin returned to Condé to claim his inheritance from his aunt and uncle, who may have been killed by the army of Louis XI in May 1478, when they besieged the town, locked the population into the church, and burned them alive.&lt;ref name=&quot;Macey&quot;&gt;Macey et al.,{{Page needed|date=May 2012}}&lt;!--Not really a page number, but a section number is needed, as in note 1.--&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Milan===
The period of 1480 to 1482 has puzzled biographers: some contradictory evidence exists, suggesting either that Josquin was still in France, or was already in the service of the [[House of Sforza|Sforza]] family, specifically with Ascanio Sforza, who had been banished from Milan and resided temporarily in Ferrara or Naples. Residence in Ferrara in the early 1480s could explain the ''Missa Hercules dux Ferrariae'', composed for Ercole d'Este, but which stylistically does not fit with the usual date of 1503–4 when Josquin was known to be in Ferrara. Alternatively it has been suggested that Josquin spent some of that time in Hungary, based on a mid-16th century Roman document describing the Hungarian court in those years, and including Josquin as one of the musicians present.&lt;ref name=&quot;Macey&quot;/&gt;

In either 1483 or 1484 Josquin is known to have been in the service of the Sforza family in Milan. While in their employ, he made one or more trips to Rome, and possibly also to Paris; while in Milan he made the acquaintance of [[Franchinus Gaffurius]], who was ''maestro di cappella'' of the cathedral there. He was in Milan again in 1489, after a possible period of travel; but he left that year.

===Rome===
From 1489 to 1495 Josquin was a member of the papal choir, first under [[Pope Innocent VIII]], and later under the [[House of Borgia|Borgia]] pope [[Pope Alexander VI|Alexander VI]]. He may have gone there as part of a singer exchange with [[Gaspar van Weerbeke]], who went back to Milan at the same time. While there, he may have been the one who carved his name into the wall of the Sistine Chapel; a &quot;JOSQUINJ&quot; was recently revealed by workers restoring the chapel. Since it was traditional for singers to carve their names into the walls, and hundreds of names were inscribed there during the period from the 15th to the 18th centuries, it is considered highly likely that the graffiti is by Josquin – and if so, it would be his only surviving autograph.&lt;ref&gt;Pietschmann&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sherr, frontispiece&lt;/ref&gt;

Josquin's mature style evolved during this period; as in Milan he had absorbed the influence of light Italian secular music, in Rome he refined his techniques of sacred music. Several of his motets have been dated to the years he spent at the papal chapel.

===Departure from Rome; Milan and France===
Around 1498 Josquin most likely re-entered the service of the Sforza family, on the evidence of a pair of letters between the [[House of Gonzaga|Gonzaga]] and Sforza families.&lt;ref name=&quot;Macey&quot;/&gt; He probably did not stay in Milan long, for in 1499 [[Louis XII of France|Louis XII]] captured Milan in his invasion of northern Italy and imprisoned Josquin's former employers. Around this time Josquin most likely returned to France, although documented details of his career around the turn of the 16th century are lacking. Prior to departing Italy he most likely wrote one of his most famous secular compositions, the frottola ''El grillo'', as well as ''In te Domine speravi'' (&quot;I have placed my hope in you, Lord&quot;), based on Psalm 30. The latter composition may have been a veiled reference to the religious reformer [[Girolamo Savonarola]], who had been burned at the stake in Florence in 1498, and for whom Josquin seems to have had a special reverence; the text was the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] friar's favorite psalm, a meditation on which he left incomplete in prison prior to his execution.&lt;ref&gt;Macey, p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of Josquin's compositions, such as the instrumental ''Vive le roy'', have been tentatively dated to the period around 1500 when he was in France. A motet, ''Memor esto verbi tui servo tuo'' (&quot;Remember thy promise unto thy servant&quot;), was, according to [[Heinrich Glarean]] writing in the ''Dodecachordon'' of 1547, composed as a gentle reminder to the king to keep his promise of a [[benefice]] to Josquin, which he had forgotten to keep. According to Glarean's story, it worked: the court applauded, and the king gave Josquin his benefice. Upon receiving it, Josquin reportedly wrote a motet on the text ''Benefecisti servo tuo, Domine'' (&quot;Lord, thou hast dealt graciously with thy servant&quot;) to show his gratitude to the king.&lt;ref&gt;David W. Barber, ''If It Ain't Baroque: More Music History as It Ought to Be Taught'' (Toronto: Sound and Vision, 1992), p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ferrara===
[[File:ercole I d'Este.jpg|250px|thumb|Ercole I d'Este was an important patron of the arts during the Italian Renaissance; he was Josquin's employer in 1503 and 1504.]]

Josquin probably remained in the service of [[Louis XII of France|Louis XII]] until 1503, when [[Ercole d'Este I|Duke Ercole I]] of [[Ferrara]] hired him for the chapel there.&lt;ref&gt;Merkley, p.&amp;nbsp;544-583{{Page needed|date=May 2012}}&lt;!--This fact cannot possibly take up forty pages; a specific page reference is needed instead of the inclusive page-range of the entire article.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; One of the rare mentions of Josquin's personality survives from this time. Prior to hiring Josquin, one of Duke Ercole's assistants recommended that he hire [[Heinrich Isaac]] instead, since Isaac was easier to get along with, more companionable, was more willing to compose on demand, and would cost significantly less (120 [[ducat]]s vs. 200). Ercole, however, chose Josquin.&lt;ref name=&quot;Macey&quot;/&gt;

While in Ferrara, Josquin wrote some of his most famous compositions, including the austere, [[Girolamo Savonarola|Savonarola]]-influenced ''[[Miserere (Josquin)|Miserere]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Macey, p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt; which became one of the most widely-distributed motets of the 16th century; the utterly contrasting, virtuoso motet ''Virgo salutiferi'';&lt;ref&gt;Milsom, p.&amp;nbsp;307.&lt;/ref&gt; and possibly the ''[[Missa Hercules Dux Ferrariae]]'', which is written on a ''[[cantus firmus]]'' derived from the musical letters in the Duke's name, a technique known as ''[[soggetto cavato]]''.

Josquin did not stay in Ferrara long. An outbreak of the [[plague (disease)|plague]] in the summer of 1503 prompted the evacuation of the Duke and his family, as well as two thirds of the citizens, and Josquin left by April of the next year, possibly also to escape the plague. His replacement, [[Jacob Obrecht]], died of the plague in the summer of 1505,&lt;ref name=&quot;Macey&quot;/&gt; to be replaced by [[Antoine Brumel]] in 1506, who stayed until the disbanding of the chapel in 1510.

===Retirement to Condé-sur-l'Escaut===
Josquin went directly from Ferrara to his home region of [[Condé-sur-l'Escaut]], southeast of [[Lille]] on the present-day border between Belgium and France, becoming provost of the collegiate church of Notre-Dame on 3 May 1504, a large musical establishment that he headed for the rest of his life.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sherr, p. 16&quot;&gt;Sherr, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; While the chapter at [[Bourges Cathedral]] asked him to become master of the choirboys there in 1508, it is not known how he responded, and there is no record of his having been employed there; most scholars presume he remained in Condé.&lt;ref&gt;Sherr, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the last two decades of his life, Josquin's fame spread abroad along with his music. The newly-developed technology of printing made wide dissemination of his music possible, and Josquin was the favorite of the first printers: one of [[Ottaviano Petrucci|Petrucci]]'s first publications, and the earliest surviving print of music by a single composer, was a book of Josquin's masses which he printed in Venice in 1502. This publication was successful enough that Petrucci published two further volumes of Josquin's masses, in 1504 and 1514, and reissued them several times.&lt;ref&gt;Boorman, Stanley. &quot;Petrucci, Ottaviano (dei).&quot; ''Music Printing and Publishing''. New York: Norton, 1990, pp. 365–369.&lt;/ref&gt;

On his death-bed Josquin asked that he be listed on the rolls as a foreigner, so that his property would not pass to the Lords and Ladies of Condé.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sherr, p. 16&quot;/&gt; This bit of evidence has been used to show that he was French by birth. Additionally, he left an endowment for the performance of his late motet, ''Pater noster/Ave Maria'', at all general processions in the town when they passed in front of his house, stopping to place a wafer on the marketplace altar to the Holy Virgin. ''Pater noster'' may have been his last work.&lt;ref&gt;Milsom, pp.&amp;nbsp;303–305.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==

===Overview===
Josquin lived during a transitional stage in music history. Musical styles were changing rapidly, in part owing to the movement of musicians between different regions of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Reese, p. 184–185.&lt;/ref&gt; Many northern musicians moved to Italy, the heart of the Renaissance, attracted by the Italian nobility's patronage of the arts; while in Italy, these composers were influenced by the native Italian styles, and often brought those ideas with them back to their homelands. The sinuous musical lines of the Ockeghem generation, the [[Counterpoint|contrapuntal]] complexity of the Netherlanders, and the homophonic textures of the Italian lauda and secular music began to merge into a unified style; indeed Josquin was to be the leading figure in this musical process, which eventually resulted in the formation of an international musical language, of which the most famous composers included [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina|Palestrina]] and [[Orlande de Lassus|Lassus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Noble&quot;&gt;Noble, Grove (1980)&lt;/ref&gt;

Josquin likely learned his craft in his home region in the North, in France, and then in Italy when he went to Milan and Rome. His early sacred works emulate the contrapuntal complexity and ornamented, melismatic lines of Ockeghem and his contemporaries, but at the same time he was learning his contrapuntal technique he was acquiring an Italianate idiom for his secular music: after all, he was surrounded by Italian popular music in Milan. By the end of his long creative career, which spanned approximately 50 productive years, he had developed a simplified style in which each voice of a polyphonic composition exhibited free and smooth motion, and close attention was paid to clear setting of text as well as clear alignment of text with musical motifs. While other composers were influential on the development of Josquin's style, especially in the late 15th century, he himself became the most influential composer in Europe, especially after the development of music printing, which was concurrent with the years of his maturity and peak output. This event made his influence even more decisive than it might otherwise have been.

Many &quot;modern&quot; musical compositional practices were being born in the era around 1500. Josquin made extensive use of &quot;motivic cells&quot; in his compositions, short, easily-recognizable melodic fragments which passed from voice to voice in a contrapuntal texture, giving it an inner unity. This is a basic organizational principle in music which has been practiced continuously from approximately 1500 until the present day.&lt;ref&gt;Irving Godt, JMT, 264–292.&lt;/ref&gt;

Josquin wrote in all of the important forms current at the time, including masses, motets, chansons, and frottole. He even contributed to the development of a new form, the [[motet-chanson]], of which he left at least three examples. In addition, some of his pieces were probably intended for instrumental performance.

Each area of his output can be further subdivided by form or by hypothetical period of composition. Since dating Josquin's compositions is particularly problematic, with scholarly consensus only achieved on a minority of works, discussion here is by type.

===Masses===
[[File:Josquin Missa BV Kyrie.jpg|thumb|Manuscript showing the opening Kyrie of the ''Missa de Beata Virgine'', a late work. (''Rome, Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana, Capp. Sist. 45, ff. 1v-2r'')|300px]]
Josquin wrote towards the end of the period in which the [[mass (music)|mass]] was the predominant form of sacred composition in Europe. The mass, as it had developed through the 15th century, was a long, multi-section form, with opportunities for large-scale structure and organization not possible in the other forms such as the [[motet]]. Josquin wrote some of the most famous examples of the genre, most using some kind of [[cyclic mass|cyclic]] organization.

He wrote masses using the following general techniques, although there is considerable overlap between techniques in individual compositions:

* [[cantus firmus mass]], in which a pre-existing tune appeared, mostly unchanged, in one voice of the texture, with the other voices being more or less freely composed;
* [[paraphrase mass]], in which a pre-existing tune was used freely in all voices, and in many variations;
* [[parody mass]], in which a pre-existing multi-voice song appeared in whole or in part, with material from all voices in use, not just the tune;
* [[soggetto cavato]], or [[solmization]] mass, in which the tune is drawn from the syllables of a name or phrase (for example &quot;la sol fa re mi&quot; — A, G, F, D, E — based on the syllables of ''Lascia fare mi'' (&quot;leave me alone&quot;, a phrase used by an unknown patron, in a context around which much legend has arisen).
* [[Canon (music)|canon]], in which an entire mass is based on canonic techniques, and no pre-existing material has been identified.&lt;ref&gt;Blackburn, Planchart, Bloxham, Sherr, in Sherr, 51–248.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of these techniques, particularly paraphrase and parody, become standardized during the first half of the 16th century; Josquin was very much a pioneer, and what was perceived as mixing of these techniques by later observers was actually the process by which they were created.&lt;ref name=&quot;Noble&quot;/&gt;

Josquin was fond of canonic techniques, as were many other composers of his generation, and canon appears in all of his masses, sometimes to the exclusion of other structural devices.

====Cantus-firmus masses====
Prior to Josquin's mature period, the most common technique for writing masses was the cantus firmus, a technique which had been in use already for most of the 15th century. It was the technique that Josquin used earliest in his career, with the ''Missa L'ami Baudichon'', possibly his first mass.&lt;ref name=&quot;Noble&quot;/&gt; This mass is based on a secular – indeed ribald – tune similar to &quot;Three Blind Mice&quot;. That basing a mass on such a source was an accepted procedure is evident from the existence of the mass in Sistine Chapel part-books copied during the papacy of [[Pope Julius II|Julius II]] (1503 to 1513).&lt;ref&gt;Blackburn, p.&amp;nbsp;72.&lt;/ref&gt;

Josquin's most famous cantus-firmus masses are the two based on the [[L'homme armé]] tune, which was the favorite tune for mass composition of the entire Renaissance. The earlier of the two, ''[[Missa L'homme armé super voces musicales]]'', is a technical tour-de-force on the tune, containing numerous [[prolation canon|mensuration canons]] and contrapuntal display. It was by far the most famous of all his masses.&lt;ref&gt;Blackburn, pp.&amp;nbsp;53–62&lt;/ref&gt; The second, ''[[Missa L'homme armé sexti toni]]'', is a &quot;fantasia on the theme of the armed man.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Blackburn, p.&amp;nbsp;63&lt;/ref&gt; While based on a cantus firmus, it is also a paraphrase mass, for fragments of the tune appear in all voices. Technically it is almost restrained, compared to the other ''L'homme armé'' mass, until the closing Agnus Dei, which contains a complex canonic structure including a rare retrograde canon, around which other voices are woven.&lt;ref&gt;Blackburn, p.&amp;nbsp;64&lt;/ref&gt;

====Paraphrase masses====
The [[paraphrase mass|paraphrase technique]] differs from the cantus-firmus technique in that the source material, though it still consists of a monophonic original, is embellished, often with ornaments. As in the cantus-firmus technique, the source tune may appear in many voices of the mass.

Several of Josquin's masses feature the paraphrase technique, and they include some of his most famous work. The relatively early ''Missa Ave maris stella'', which probably dates from his years in the Sistine Chapel choir, paraphrases the [[Marian antiphon]] of the [[Ave Maris Stella|same name]]; it is also one of his shortest masses.&lt;ref&gt;Planchart, in Sherr, p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; The late ''[[Missa de Beata Virgine (Josquin)|Missa de Beata Virgine]]'' paraphrases plainchants in praise of the Virgin Mary; it is a [[Lady Mass]], a votive mass for Saturday performance, and was his most popular mass in the 16th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Noble&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Planchart, in Sherr, p. 120–130&lt;/ref&gt;

By far the most famous of Josquin's masses using the technique, and one of the most famous mass settings of the entire era, was the ''[[Missa Pange lingua|Missa pange lingua]]'', based on the hymn by [[Thomas Aquinas]] for the Vespers of Corpus Christi. It was probably the last mass that Josquin composed.&lt;ref&gt;Planchart, in Sherr, p. 130, 132.&lt;/ref&gt; This mass is an extended [[Fantasia (music)|fantasia]] on the tune, using the melody in all voices and in all parts of the mass, in elaborate and ever-changing polyphony. One of the high points of the mass is the ''et incarnatus est'' section of the Credo, where the texture becomes homophonic, and the tune appears in the topmost voice; here the portion which would normally set &quot;Sing, O my tongue, of the mystery of the divine body&quot; is instead given the words &quot;And he became incarnate by the Holy Ghost from the Virgin Mary, and was made man.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Planchart, in Sherr, p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Parody masses, masses on popular songs====
In parody masses, the source material was not a single line, but an entire texture, often of a popular song. Several works by Josquin fall loosely into this category, including the ''Missa Fortuna desperata'', based on the three-voice song ''[[Fortuna desperata]]'' (possibly by [[Antoine Busnois]]); the ''Missa Malheur me bat'' (based on a chanson variously ascribed to [[Jacob Obrecht|Obrecht]], [[Johannes Ockeghem|Ockeghem]], or, most likely, [[Abertijne Malcourt]]);&lt;ref name=&quot;Noble&quot;/&gt; and the ''Missa Mater Patris'', based on a three-voice motet by [[Antoine Brumel]]. The ''Missa Mater Patris'' is probably the first true parody mass to be composed, for it no longer contains any hint of a cantus firmus.&lt;ref&gt;Reese, p. 240.&lt;/ref&gt; Parody technique was to become the most usual means of mass composition for the remainder of the 16th century, although the mass gradually fell out of favor as the motet grew in esteem.

====Masses on solmization syllables====
The earliest known mass by any composer using this method of composition – the ''[[soggetto cavato]]'' – is the ''[[Missa Hercules Dux Ferrariae]]'', which Josquin probably wrote in the early 1480s for the powerful [[Ercole d'Este I|Ercole I]], Duke of Ferrara. The notes of the cantus firmus are drawn from the musical syllables of the Duke's own name: Re – Ut – Re – Ut – Re – Fa – Mi – Re.&lt;!-- To be honest, I'm not getting this one. Mak.--&gt; Another mass using this technique is the ''[[Missa La sol fa re mi]]'', based on the musical syllables contained in &quot;Lascia fare mi&quot; (&quot;leave me alone!&quot;). The story, as told by [[Heinrich Glarean|Glareanus]] in 1547, was that an unknown aristocrat used to order suitors away with this phrase, and Josquin immediately wrote an &quot;exceedingly elegant&quot; mass on it as a jab at him.&lt;ref&gt;Blackburn, p.&amp;nbsp;78.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Canonic masses====
[[File:Josquin Missa Lhomme arme super voces musicales Agnus Dei II opening.png|right|thumb|550px|Opening of the Agnus Dei II from the ''[[Missa L'homme armé super voces musicales]]''. The movement consists of a three-out-of-one mensuration canon. The middle voice is the slowest; the lowest voice sings at twice the speed of the middle voice, and the top voice at three times the speed. The first four notes of the canon are shown connected by lines of the same color. (The first eight notes of the canon are a quotation of the contratenor of [[Johannes Ockeghem|Ockeghem]]'s &quot;Ma bouche rit&quot;)]]
Canonic masses came into increasing prominence in the latter part of the 15th century. Early examples include Ockeghem's famous ''[[Missa prolationum]]'', consisting entirely of [[mensuration canon]]s, the ''Missa L'homme armé'' of [[Guillaume Faugues]], whose cantus firmus is presented in canon at the descending fifth, and the ''Missa'' [''Ad fugam''] of [[Marbrianus de Orto]], based on freely composed canons at the fifth between superius and tenor. Josquin makes use of canon in the Osanna and Agnus Dei III of the ''Missa L'homme armé sexti toni'', throughout the ''Missa Sine nomine'', and in the final three movements of the ''Missa De beata virgine''. The ''[[Missa L'homme armé super voces musicales]]'' incorporates mensuration canons in the Kyrie, Benedictus, and Agnus Dei II.&lt;ref&gt;A canon from the Agnus Dei II from the ''Missa L'homme armé super voces musicales'' is written in a triangular form in [[Dosso Dossi]]'s ''Allegory of Music.'' ''See'' the entry [[Eye music]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Motets===
Josquin's motet style varied from almost strictly homophonic settings with block chords and syllabic text declamation to highly ornate contrapuntal fantasias, to the psalm settings which combined these extremes with the addition of rhetorical figures and text-painting that foreshadowed the later development of the madrigal. He wrote many of his motets for four voices, an ensemble size which had become the compositional norm around 1500, and he also was a considerable innovator in writing motets for five and six voices.&lt;ref&gt;Milsom, p.&amp;nbsp;282&lt;/ref&gt; No motets of more than six voices have been reliably attributed to Josquin.

[[File:Josquin Cor meum.png|thumb|right|400px|A passage from the psalm motet ''Domine ne in furore'' (Ps. 37). Three variants of a motive built on a major triad are introduced, each in paired imitation between two voices.]]
Almost all of Josquin's motets use some kind of compositional constraint on the process; they are not freely composed.&lt;ref&gt;Milsom, p.&amp;nbsp;284&lt;/ref&gt; Some of them use a cantus firmus as a unifying device; some are canonic; some use a motto which repeats throughout; some use several of these methods. The motets that use canon can be roughly divided into two groups: those in which the canon is plainly designed to be heard and appreciated as such, and another group in which a canon is present, but almost impossible to hear, and seemingly written to be appreciated by the eye, and by connoisseurs.&lt;ref&gt;Milsom, p.&amp;nbsp;290&lt;/ref&gt;

Josquin frequently used imitation, especially paired imitation, in writing his motets, with sections akin to fugal expositions occurring on successive lines of the text he was setting. An example is his setting of ''Dominus regnavit'' (Psalm 93), for four voices; each of the lines of the psalm begins with a voice singing a new tune alone, quickly followed by entries of other three voices in imitation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reese_249&quot;&gt;Reese, p. 249&lt;/ref&gt;

In writing polyphonic settings of psalms, Josquin was a pioneer, and psalm settings form a large proportion of the motets of his later years. Few composers prior to Josquin had written polyphonic psalm settings.&lt;ref&gt;Reese, p. 246&lt;/ref&gt; Some of Josquin's settings include the famous ''[[Miserere (Josquin)|Miserere]]'', written in Ferrara in 1503 or 1504 and most likely inspired by the recent execution of the reformist monk Girolamo Savonarola,&lt;ref&gt;Macey, p. xxx&lt;/ref&gt; ''Memor esto verbi tui'', based on Psalm 119, and two settings of ''[[Psalm 130|De profundis]]'' (Psalm 130), both of which are often considered to be among his most significant accomplishments.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reese_249&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Milsom, p.&amp;nbsp;305&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chansons and instrumental compositions===
{{redirect|El Grillo|the Guatemalan football coach|Jorge Roldán}}
In the domain of secular music, Josquin left numerous French [[chanson]]s, for from three to six voices, as well as a handful of Italian secular songs known as [[frottola|frottole]], as well as some pieces which were probably intended for instrumental performance. Problems of attribution are even more acute with the chansons than they are with other portions of his output: while about 70 three and four-voice chansons were published under his name during his lifetime, only six of the more than thirty five- and six-voice chansons attributed to him were circulated under his name during the same time. Many of the attributions added after his death are considered to be unreliable, and much work has been done in the last decades of the 20th century to correct attributions on stylistic grounds.&lt;ref&gt;Louise Litterick, in Sherr, p. 335, 393&lt;/ref&gt;

Josquin's earliest chansons were probably composed in northern Europe, under the influence of composers such as Ockeghem and Busnois. Unlike them, however, he never adhered strictly to the conventions of the ''[[formes fixes]]'' – the rigid and complex repetition patterns of the [[rondeau (music)|rondeau]], [[virelai]], and [[ballade (music)|ballade]] – instead he often wrote his early chansons in strict [[imitation (music)|imitation]], a feature they shared with many of his sacred works.&lt;ref name=&quot;Noble&quot;/&gt; He was one of the first composers of chansons to make all voices equal parts of the texture; and many of his chansons contain points of imitation, in the manner of motets. However he did use melodic repetition, especially where the lines of text rhymed, and many of his chansons had a lighter texture, as well a faster tempo, than his motets.

Inside of his chansons, he often used a cantus firmus, sometimes a popular song whose origin can no longer be traced, as in ''Si j'avoye Marion''.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Grove (1980), &quot;Chanson.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Other times he used a tune originally associated with a separate text; and still other times he freely composed an entire song, using no apparent external source material. Another technique he sometimes used was to take a popular song and write it as a canon with itself, in two inner voices, and write new melodic material above and around it, to a new text: he used this technique in one of his most famous chansons, ''Faulte d'argent'' (&quot;The problem with money&quot;), a song sung by a man who wakes in bed with a prostitute, broke and unable to pay her.

Some of his chansons were doubtless designed to be performed instrumentally. That Petrucci published many of them without text is strong evidence of this; additionally, some of the pieces (for example, the fanfare-like ''Vive le roy'') contain writing more idiomatic for instruments than voices.&lt;ref name=&quot;Noble&quot;/&gt;

Josquin's most famous chansons circulated widely in Europe. Some of the better known include his [[lament]] on the death of Ockeghem, ''[[Nymphes des bois|Nymphes des bois/Requiem aeternam]]''; ''[[Mille Regretz|Mille regretz]]'' (the attribution of which has recently been questioned);&lt;ref&gt;Litterick, in Sherr, p. 374–376&lt;/ref&gt; ''Plus nulz regretz''; and ''Je me complains''.

In addition to his French chansons, he wrote at least three pieces in the manner of the Italian [[frottola]], a popular Italian song form which he would have encountered during his years in Milan. These songs include ''[[Scaramella]]'', ''El grillo'', and ''[[In te domine speravi]]''. They are even simpler in texture than his French chansons, being almost uniformly syllabic and homophonic, and they remain among the most frequently sung portions of his output.

===Motet-chansons===
While in Milan, Josquin wrote several examples of a new type of piece developed by the composers there, the [[motet-chanson]]. These compositions were texturally very similar to 15th century chansons in the ''[[formes fixes]]'' mold, except that unlike those completely secular works, they contained a [[Gregorian chant|chant]]-derived Latin cantus-firmus in the lowest of the three voices. The other voices, in French, sang a secular text which had either a symbolic relationship to the sacred Latin text, or commented on it.&lt;ref&gt;Litterick, in Sherr, p. 336&lt;/ref&gt; Josquin's three known motet-chansons, ''Que vous madame/In pace'', ''A la mort/Monstra te esse matrem'', and ''Fortune destrange plummaige/Pauper sum ego'', are similar stylistically to those by the other composers of the Milan chapel, such as [[Loyset Compère]] and [[Alexander Agricola]].

==Influence==
Josquin's fame lasted throughout the 16th century, and indeed increased for several decades after his death. [[Gioseffo Zarlino|Zarlino]], writing in the 1580s, was still using examples from Josquin in his treatises on composition; and Josquin's fame was only eclipsed after the beginning of the [[Baroque music|Baroque]] era, with the decline of the pre-tonal polyphonic style. During the 18th and 19th centuries Josquin's fame was overshadowed by later [[Roman School]] composer [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina|Palestrina]], whose music was seen as the summit of polyphonic refinement, and codified into a system of composition by theorists such as [[Johann Fux]]; however, during the 20th century, Josquin's reputation has grown steadily, to the point where scholars again consider him &quot;the greatest and most successful composer of the age.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;David Fallows, in Sherr, p.&amp;nbsp;575.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Higgins, {{Page needed|date=May 2012}}&lt;!--It does not take 68 pages to make this simple statement.--&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Richard Sherr, writing in the introduction to the ''Josquin Companion'', addressing specifically the shrinking of Josquin's canon due to correction of misattributions, &quot;Josquin will survive because his best music really is as magnificent as everybody has always said it was.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sherr_10&quot;/&gt;

Since the 1950s Josquin's reputation has been boosted by the increasing availability of recordings, of which there are many, and the rise of ensembles specializing in the performance of 16th century vocal music, many of which consider Josquin's output to be at the heart of their repertoire.&lt;ref&gt;Sherr, p. 577; also Appendix B (Discography)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works list==
The difficulties in compiling a works list for Josquin cannot be overstated. Because of his immense prestige in the early sixteenth century, many scribes and publishers did not resist the temptation of attributing anonymous or otherwise spurious works to Josquin. The German editor Georg Forster summed up the situation admirably in 1540 when he wrote, &quot;Now that Josquin is dead, he is putting out more works than when he was alive.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Jesse Rodin, &quot;A Josquin Substitution,&quot; ''Early Music 34.2 (2006), p. 246&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the authenticity of many of the works listed below is disputed.

'''Gait''' is the pattern of [[Motion (physics)|movement]] of the [[limb (anatomy)|limb]]s of animals, including [[Gait (human)|humans]], during [[locomotion]] over a solid substrate. Most animals use a variety of gaits, selecting gait based on [[speed]], [[terrain]], the need to [[wikt:maneuver|maneuver]], and energetic efficiency.  Different animal species may use different gaits due to differences in [[anatomy]] that prevent use of certain gaits, or simply due to evolved innate preferences as a result of habitat differences.  While various gaits are given specific names, the complexity of biological systems and interacting with the environment make these distinctions 'fuzzy' at best.  Gaits are typically classified according to footfall patterns, but recent studies often prefer definitions based on mechanics.  The term typically does not refer to limb-based propulsion through fluid mediums such as water or air, but rather to propulsion across a solid substrate by generating reactive forces against it (which can apply to walking while underwater as well as on land).

Due to the rapidity of animal movement, simple direct observation is rarely sufficient to give any insight into the pattern of limb movement.  In spite of early attempts to classify gaits based on footprints or the sound of footfalls, it wasn't until [[Eadweard Muybridge]] and [[Étienne-Jules Marey]] began taking rapid series of photographs that proper scientific examination of gaits could begin.  

{{Wiktionary|gait}}

==Overview==
[[Milton Hildebrand]] pioneered the scientific analysis and the classification of gaits.  The movement of each limb was partitioned into a stance phase, where the foot was in contact with the ground, and a swing phase, where the foot was lifted and moved forwards.  Each limb must complete a [[period (physics)|cycle in the same length of time]], otherwise one limb's relationship to the others can change with time, and a steady pattern cannot occur.  Thus, any gait can completely be described in terms of the beginning and end of stance phase of three limbs relative to a cycle of a reference limb, usually the left [[hindlimb]].

==Variables==
[[Image:Gait graphs.jpg|thumb|500px|Gait graphs in the style of Hildebrand. Dark areas indicate times of contact, bottom axis is % of cycle]]
Gaits are generally classed as &quot;symmetrical&quot; and &quot;asymmetrical&quot; based on limb movement.  It is important to note that these terms have nothing to do with [[left-right symmetry]].  In a symmetrical gait, the left and right limbs of a pair alternate, while in an asymmetrical gait, the limbs move together.   Asymmetrical gaits are sometimes termed &quot;leaping gaits&quot;, due to the presence of a suspended phase.

The key [[Variable (research)|variables]] for gait are the duty factor and the [[forelimb]]-hindlimb phase relationship. Duty factor is simply the percent of the total cycle which a given foot is on the ground.  This value will usually be the same for forelimbs and hindlimbs unless the animal is moving with a specially-trained gait or is [[Acceleration|accelerating]] or [[decelerating]].  Duty factors over 50% are considered a &quot;walk&quot;, while those less than 50% are considered a run. Forelimb-hindlimb phase is the [[Time|temporal]] relationship between the limb pairs.  If the same-side forelimbs and hindlimbs initiate stance phase at the same time, the phase is 0 (or 100%).  If the same-side forelimb contacts the ground half of the cycle later than the hindlimb, the phase is 50%.

==Differences between species==
Any given animal uses a relatively restricted set of gaits, and different species use different gaits.  Almost all animals are capable of symmetrical gaits, while asymmetrical gaits are largely confined to [[mammal]]s, who are capable of enough [[Vertebral column|spinal]] flexion to increase stride length (though small [[crocodilia]]ns are capable of using a bounding gait).  [[Ambling|Lateral sequence gaits]] during walking and running are most common in mammals, but [[arboreal]] mammals such as [[monkey]]s, some [[possum]]s, and [[kinkajou]]s use diagonal sequence walks for enhanced stability.  Diagonal sequence walks and runs (aka trots) are most frequently used by sprawling [[tetrapod]]s such as [[salamander]]s and [[lizard]]s, due to the lateral oscillations of their bodies during movement. [[Bipeds]] are a unique case, and most bipeds will display only three gaits - walking, running, and hopping - during natural locomotion.  Other gaits, such as human skipping, are not used without deliberate effort.

==Physiological effects of gait==
Gait choice can have effects beyond immediate changes in limb movement and speed, notably in terms of [[ventilation (physiology)|ventilation]].  Because they lack a [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]], lizards and salamanders must expand and contract their body wall in order to force air in and out of their lungs, but these are the same muscles used to laterally undulate the body during locomotion.  Thus, they cannot move and breathe at the same time, a situation called [[Carrier's constraint]], though some, such as [[monitor lizards]], can circumvent this restriction via [[buccal pumping]].  In contrast, the spinal flexion of a galloping mammal causes the abdominal [[viscera]] to act as a piston, inflating and deflating the lungs as the animal's spine flexes and extends, increasing ventilation and allowing greater [[breathing|oxygen exchange]].

==Energy-based gait classification==
While gaits can be classified by footfall, new work involving whole-body [[kinematics]] and force-plate records has given rise to an alternative classification scheme, based on the mechanics of the [[Motion (physics)|movement]].  In this scheme, movements are divided into walking and running.  Walking gaits are all characterized by a 'vaulting' movement of the body over the legs, frequently described as in inverted pendulum (displaying fluctuations in kinetic and [[potential energy]] which are perfectly out of phase).  In running, the kinetic and potential energy fluctuate in-phase, and the energy change is passed on to [[muscle]]s, [[bone]]s, [[tendon]]s and [[ligament]]s acting as springs (thus it is described by the [[spring-mass model]]).

==Energetics==
Speed generally governs gait selection, with [[quadrupedal]] mammals moving from a walk to a run to a gallop as speed increases.  Each of these gaits has an optimum speed, at which the minimum calories per meter are consumed, and costs increase at slower or faster speeds.  Gait transitions occur near the speed where the cost of a fast walk becomes higher than the cost of a slow run.  Unrestrained animals will typically move at the optimum speed for their gait to minimize energy cost.

==Non-tetrapod gaits==
In spite of the differences in leg number shown in [[Terrestrial animal|terrestrial]] [[vertebrate]]s, according to the [[inverted pendulum]] model of walking and spring-mass model of running, &quot;walks&quot; and &quot;runs&quot; are seen in animals with 2, 4, 6, or more legs.  The term 'gait' has even been applied to flying and swimming organisms who produce distinct patterns of wake [[vortices]].

{{History of China}}

The '''Jīn Dynasty''' ([[Jurchen language|Jurchen]]: Anchun Gurun; {{zh|c=金朝|p=Jīn Cháo|w=Chin Dynasty}}, {{IPA-cmn|tɕîn tʂʰɑ̌ʊ̯|IPA}}); [[Manchu language|Manchu]]: Aisin Gurun; [[Khitan language]]: Nik, Niku;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.surag.net/viewArticle.do?method=viewArticle&amp;id= 关于契丹小字中的 “金”]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apu.ac.jp/~yoshim/ginnhei.pdf 天朝万顺(岁)”臆解可以休矣]&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-mn|Altan Ulus}}; 1115–1234), also known as the ''Jurchen Dynasty'' or ''Jurched Dynasty'', was founded by the [[Wanyan]] (完顏 Wányán) [[clan]] of the [[Jurchens]], the ancestors of the [[Manchus]] who established the [[Qing Dynasty]] some 500 years later. The name is sometimes written as ''Jinn'' to differentiate it from an earlier [[Jin Dynasty (265–420)|Jìn Dynasty]] of [[China]] whose name is identically [[Pinyin|spelled using the Latin alphabet]].

==History==
[[Image:Premongol.png|thumb|left|Map of [[Asia]] and parts of [[Europe]] and [[Africa]] circa 1200]]
The Jin Dynasty was founded in what would become northern [[Manchuria]] by the [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]] tribal chieftain [[Wanyan Aguda]] (完顏阿骨打) in 1115. The Jurchens' early rival was the [[Liao Dynasty]], which had held sway over [[Northern and southern China|northern China]], including [[Manchuria]] and part of the [[Mongol]] region for several centuries.  In 1121, the Jurchens entered into the [[Alliance on the Sea]] with the [[Song Dynasty]] and agreed to jointly invade the Liao.  While the Song armies faltered, the Jurchens succeeded in [[Western Liao|driving the Liao to Central Asia]].
In 1125, after the death of Aguda, the Jin broke the alliance with the Song and invaded North China.  On January 9, 1127, Jin forces [[Jingkang Incident|ransacked]] [[Kaifeng]], capital of the [[Northern Song Dynasty]], capturing both [[Emperor Qinzong of Song China|Emperor Qinzong]] and his father, [[Emperor Huizong of Song China|Emperor Huizong]], who had abdicated in panic in the face of Jin forces. Following the fall of Kaifeng, the succeeding [[Southern Song Dynasty]] continued to fight the Jin for over a decade, eventually signing the [[Treaty of Shaoxing]] in 1141, which called for the cession of all Song land north of the [[Huai River]] to the Jin and the execution of Song General [[Yue Fei]] in return for peace.

===The migration south===
[[File:Jade ornament grapes jin dynasty shanghai museum 2004 07 22.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jade]] ornament with flower design, Jin Dynasty, [[Shanghai Museum]].]]
After taking over [[Northern and southern China|Northern China]], the Jin Dynasty became increasingly Sinicized. About three million people, half of them [[Jurchens]], migrated south into northern China over two decades, and this minority governed about thirty million people. The Jurchens were given land grants and organized society into 1,000 households  - ''meng'an'') and 100 households  - ''mouke''). Many married Hans, although the ban on Jurchen nobles marrying Hans was not lifted until 1191. After Jin [[Emperor Taizong of Jin|Emperor Tàizōng]]  died in 1135, the next three Jin emperors were grandsons of [[Wanyan Aguda|Wányán Āgǔdǎ]] by three different princes. Young Jin [[Emperor Xizong of Jin|Emperor Xīzōng]]  (r. 1135–1149) studied the classics and wrote Chinese poetry. He adopted Han cultural traditions, but the Jurchen nobles had the top positions.

[[File:China 11b.jpg|thumb|right|Jin Dynasty, Sourthen Song Dynasty, Western Xia Dynasty and Dali Dynasty 1142.]]
Later in life, Emperor Xīzōng became an alcoholic and executed many officials for criticizing him. He also had Jurchen leaders who opposed him murdered, even those in his own Wanyan family clan. In 1149 he was murdered by a cabal of relatives and nobles, who made his cousin Wányán Liàng  the next Jin emperor. Because of the brutality of both his domestic and foreign policy, Wanyan Liang was posthumously demoted from the position of emperor. Consequently, historians have commonly referred to him by the [[posthumous name]] of [[Emperor Hailingwang of Jin|King Hǎilíng]].&lt;ref name=&quot;multiref1&quot;&gt;[http://www.san.beck.org/AB3-China.html#9 Ethics of China 7 BC To 1279 by Sanderson Beck&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rebellions in the north===
Having usurped the throne,  [[Emperor Hailingwang of Jin|Wanyan Liang]] embarked on the program of legitimizing his rule as an emperor of China. In 1153, he moved the empire's main capital from [[Huining Fu]] in northern Manchuria (south of present-day [[Harbin]]) to the former Liao capital, Yanjing (now [[Beijing]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;multiref1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=tao44&gt;Tao (1976), p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;
Four years later, in 1157, to emphasize the permanence of the move, he razed the nobles’ residences in Huining.&lt;ref name=&quot;multiref1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=tao44/&gt;
Hǎilíng also reconstructed the former Song capital, Bianjing (now [[Kaifeng]]), which had been sacked in 1127, making it the Jin's southern capital.&lt;ref name=&quot;multiref1&quot;/&gt;

Prince Hǎilíng also tried to suppress dissent by killing Jurchen nobles, executing 155 princes.&lt;ref name=&quot;multiref1&quot;/&gt;

To fulfill his dream of becoming the ruler of all China, Prince Hǎilíng attacked the [[Southern Song]] in 1161. Meanwhile, two simultaneous rebellions erupted in [[Manchuria]]: one of [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]] nobles, led by Hǎilíng's cousin, soon-to-be crowned [[Emperor Shizong of Jin|Wányán Yōng]] (完顏雍), and the other of [[Khitan people|Khitan]] tribesmen. Hǎilíng had to withdraw Jin troops from southern China to quell the uprisings. The Jin were defeated in the [[Battle of Caishi]] and [[Battle of Tangdao]]. With a depleted military force, Prince Hǎilíng failed to make headway in his attempted invasion of the [[Southern Song]]. Finally he was assassinated by his own generals in December of 1161, due to his defeats. His son and heir was also assassinated in the capital.&lt;ref name=&quot;multiref1&quot;/&gt;

[[Image:Luohan.jpg|thumb|left|A [[marble]] statue of a [[Buddhist]] monk, 1180 AD, Jin Dynasty.]]
Although crowned in October,  Wányán Yōng was not officially recognized as Jin [[Emperor Shizong of Jin|Emperor Shìzōng]] (世宗) until the murder of Prince Hǎilíng's heir.&lt;ref name=&quot;multiref1&quot;/&gt; The Khitan uprising was not suppressed until 1164; their horses were confiscated so that the rebels had to take up farming. Other Khitan and [[Kumo Xi|Xi]] cavalry units had been incorporated into the Jin army. Because these internal uprisings had severely weakened the Jin's capacity to confront the Southern Song militarily, the Jin court under Emperor Shizong began negotiating for peace. The [[Treaty of Lóngxīng]] (隆興和議) was signed in 1164 and ushered over 40 years of peace between the two empires.

[[Image:Wood Bodhisattva 2.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A wooden [[Bodhisattva]] statue, Jin Dynasty, [[Shanghai Museum]].]]
In the early 1180s Emperor Shìzōng instituted a restructuring of 200 ''meng'an'' units to remove tax abuses and help Jurchens. Communal farming was encouraged. The Jin empire prospered and had a large surplus of grain in reserve. Although learned in Chinese classics, Shizong was also known as a promoter of [[Jurchen language]] and culture; during his reign, a number of Chinese classics were translated into Jurchen, the Imperial Jurchen Academy was founded, and the [[Imperial examination]]s started to be offered in the Jurchen language.&lt;ref name=tao69&gt;Tao (1976), Chapter 6. &quot;The Jurchen Movement for Revival&quot;, Pages 69-83.&lt;/ref&gt; Shizong's reign (1161–1189) was remembered by the posterity as the time of comparative peace and prosperity, and the emperor himself was compared to the legendary [[Yao (ruler)|Yao]] and [[Shun (Chinese leader)|Shun]]&lt;ref name=tao69/&gt;

Shìzōng's grandson, [[Emperor Zhāngzōng]] (章宗) (r. 1189–1208) venerated Jurchen values, but he also immersed himself in Chinese culture and married an ethnic Han woman. The ''[[Taihe Code of law]]'' was promulgated in 1201 and was based mostly on the [[Tang Code]]. In 1207 the Song tried to invade, but the Jin forces effectively repulsed them. In the peace agreement the Song had to pay higher annual indemnities and behead [[Han Tuozhou|Hán Tūozhòu]] (韩侂胄), the leader of their war party.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinaknowledge.de/History/Song/song-event.html Chinese History - Song Dynasty 宋 event history (www.chinaknowledge.de)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fall of Jin===
{{Main|Mongol-Jin War}}
{{History of Manchuria}}
Starting from the early 13th century the Jin Dynasty began to feel the pressure of [[Mongol]]s from the north. [[Genghis Khan]] first led the Mongols into [[Western Xia]] territory in 1205 and ravaged them four years later. In 1211 about 50,000 Mongols on horses invaded the Jin Empire and began absorbing Khitan and Jurchen rebels. The Jin army had a half million men with 150,000 cavalry but abandoned the “western capital” [[Datong]] (see also [[Badger's Mount Campaign]]). The next year the Mongols went north and looted the Jin &quot;eastern capital&quot;, and in 1213 they besieged the &quot;central capital&quot;, [[Zhongdu]] (Beijing). In 1214 the Jin made a humiliating treaty but retained the capital. That summer, Jin [[Emperor Xuānzōng]] (宣宗) abandoned the central capital and moved the government to the &quot;southern capital&quot; of Kaifeng, making it the official seat of Jin Dynasty power. In 1216 a war faction persuaded Xuānzōng to attack the Song, but in 1219 they were defeated at the same place by the [[Yangtze River]], where Prince Hǎilíng had been defeated in 1161. The Jin now faced a two front war which they could not afford. Furthermore, the Jin [[Emperor Āizōng]] (哀宗) won a succession struggle against his brother and then quickly ended the war and went back to the capital. He made peace with the [[Tanguts]], who had been allied with the Mongols. Genghis Khan died in 1227 while his armies were conquering the [[Western Xia Dynasty]]. His son [[Ögedei Khan]] invaded the Jin Empire in 1232 with assistance from the [[Southern Song]]. The Jurchens tried to resist; but when Kaifeng was attacked, Āizōng fled south. An allied army of Song and Mongols looted the capital in 1233, and the next year Āizōng committed suicide to avoid being captured, ending the Jin dynasty in 1234.&lt;ref name=&quot;multiref1&quot;/&gt; The territory of the Jin was to be divided between the Mongols and the Song. However, due to lingering territorial disputes, the Song and the Mongols eventually went to war with one another over these territories.

In ''Empire of The Steppes'', [[René Grousset]] reports that the Mongols were always amazed at the valor of the Jin warriors, who held out until seven years after the death of [[Genghis Khan]].

==The Jin military==

Contemporary Chinese writers ascribed Jurchen success in overwhelming the Liao and Northern Song mainly to their cavalry. Already during [[Wanyan Aguda|Aguda]]'s rebellion against the Liao, all Jurchen fighters were mounted. It was said that the Jurchen cavalry tactics were a carryover from their hunting skills.&lt;ref name=tao21&gt;Tao (1976),  Chapter 2. &quot;The Rise of the Chin Dynasty&quot;, Pages 21-24.&lt;/ref&gt;
Jurchen horsemen were provided with heavy armor; on occasions, they would use a team of horses attached to each other with chains (拐子马, ''guaizi ma'')&lt;ref name=tao21/&gt;

As the Liao Empire fell apart and the Song retreated beyond the [[Yangtze]], the army of the new Jin Dynasty absorbed many soldiers who formerly fought for the Liao or Song.&lt;ref name=tao21/&gt; The new Jin empire adopted many of the Song's weapons, including various machines for [[siege warfare]] and [[artillery]]. In fact, the Jin use of cannons, grenades, and even rockets to defend besieged [[Kaifeng]] against the Mongols in 1233 is considered the first ever battle in human history in which gunpowder was used effectively, even though it failed to prevent the eventual Jin defeat.&lt;ref name=tao21/&gt;

On the other hand, Jin Empire was not particularly good at naval warfare. Both in 1129–30 and in 1161 Jin forces were defeated by the [[Southern Song Dynasty|Southern Song]] navies when trying to cross the Yangtze River into the core [[Southern Song Dynasty|Southern Song]] territory (see [[Battle of Tangdao]] and [[Battle of Caishi]]), even though for the latter campaign the Jin had equipped a large navy of their own, using Chinese shipbuildiers and even Chinese captains who had defected from the Southern Song.&lt;ref name=tao21/&gt;

In 1130 the Jin army reached Hangzhou and Ningbo in southern China. But heavy Chinese resistance and the geography of the area halted the Jin advance, and they were forced retreat and withdraw, and they had not been able to escape the Song navy when trying to return until they were directed by a Chinese defector who helped them escape in [[Zhenjiang|Chenkiang]]. Southern China was then cleared of the Jurchen forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |accessdate=14 December 2011|quote=The emperor Kao-tsung had taken flight to Ningpo (then known as Mingchow) and later to the port of Wenchow, south of Chekiang. From Nanking the Kin general Wu-chu hastened in pursuit and captured Hangchow and Ningpo (end of 1129 and beginning of 1130. However, the Kin army, consisting entirely of cavalry, had ventured too far into this China of the south with its flooded lands, intersecting rivers, paddy fields and canals, and dense population which harassed and encircled it. We-chu, leader of the Kin troops, sought to return north but was halted by the Yangtze, now wide as a sea and patrolled by Chinese flotillas. At last a traitor showed him how he might cross the river near Chenkiang, east of Nanking (1130).|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=CHzGvqRbV_IC&amp;pg=PA137&amp;dq=The+emperor+Kao-tsung+had+taken+flight+to+Ningpo+(then+known+as+Mingchow)+and+later+to+the+port+of+Wenchow,+south+of+Chekiang.+From+Nanking+the+Kin+general+Wu-chu+hastened+in+pursuit+and+captured+Hangchow+and+Ningpo+(end+of+1129+and+beginning+of+1130.+However,+the+Kin+army,+consisting+entirely+of+cavalry,+had+ventured+too+far+into+this+China+of+the+south+with+its+flooded+lands,+intersecting+rivers,+paddy+fields+and+canals,+and+dense+population+which+harassed+and+encircled+it.+We-chu,+leader+of+the+Kin+troops,+sought+to+return+north&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Wk8ST_fpIsHd0QGV5OzHAw&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20emperor%20Kao-tsung%20had%20taken%20flight%20to%20Ningpo%20(then%20known%20as%20Mingchow)%20and%20later%20to%20the%20port%20of%20Wenchow%2C%20south%20of%20Chekiang.%20From%20Nanking%20the%20Kin%20general%20Wu-chu%20hastened%20in%20pursuit%20and%20captured%20Hangchow%20and%20Ningpo%20(end%20of%201129%20and%20beginning%20of%201130.%20However%2C%20the%20Kin%20army%2C%20consisting%20entirely%20of%20cavalry%2C%20had%20ventured%20too%20far%20into%20this%20China%20of%20the%20south%20with%20its%20flooded%20lands%2C%20intersecting%20rivers%2C%20paddy%20fields%20and%20canals%2C%20and%20dense%20population%20which%20harassed%20and%20encircled%20it.%20We-chu%2C%20leader%20of%20the%20Kin%20troops%2C%20sought%20to%20return%20north&amp;f=false|title=The Empire of the Steppes: A History of Central Asia|author=René Grousset|editor=|edition=reprint, illustrated|volume=|series=|year=1970|location=|publisher=Rutgers University Press|language=|isbn=0-8135-1304-9|page=137|pages=|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |accessdate=14 December 2011|quote=Nanking and Hangchow were taken by assault in 1129 and in 1130 the Jürchen ventured as far as Ning-po, in the north-eastern tip of Chekiang.|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=jqb7L-pKCV8C&amp;q=ning+po#v=snippet&amp;q=ventured%20ning%20po%20north-eastern%20Chekiang&amp;f=false|title=A history of Chinese civilization|author=Jacques Gernet|editor=|edition=2, illustrated, revised|volume=|series=|year=1996|location= |publisher=Cambridge University Press|language=|isbn=0-521-49781-7|page=357|pages=|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rise of the Manchus===
{{Expand section|date=October 2009}}
After thirty years of struggle, the Jurchen chief [[Nurhaci]] (努爾哈赤) combined the three Jurchen tribes and founded the [[Qing Dynasty|Later Jin Dynasty]] (1616–1636). Nurhaci's eighth son and heir, [[Huang Taiji|Huáng Tàijí]] (皇太極), later changed the name of his people from [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]] to [[Manchu people|Manchu]] in 1635. The next year, he changed the name of the Later Jin to [[Qing Dynasty|Qing]] in 1636.

[[NBA Draft|Drafted]] into the NBA sixth overall by the [[Boston Celtics]] in [[1978 NBA Draft|1978]], Bird started at [[small forward]] and [[Power forward (basketball)|power forward]] for thirteen seasons, spearheading one of the NBA's most formidable frontcourts that included center [[Robert Parish]] and forward [[Kevin McHale (basketball)|Kevin McHale]]. Bird was a 12-time [[NBA All-Star]] and was named  the [[NBA Most Valuable Player Award|league's Most Valuable Player]] (MVP) three times. He played his entire professional career for Boston, winning three [[NBA championship]]s.

Due to chronic back problems, he retired as a player in [[1991–92 NBA season|1992]].  He was a member of the [[1992 United States men's Olympic basketball team|Dream Team]] that won the gold medal at the [[1992 Summer Olympics]]. Bird was voted to the [[NBA's 50th Anniversary All-Time Team]]&lt;ref name=birdsummary&gt;[http://www.nba.com/history/players/bird_summary.html Larry Bird summary] NBA.com.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1996 and inducted into the [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hoophall.com/halloffamers/bird.htm Hoophall.com]{{dead link|date=July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1998. He served as head coach of the [[Indiana Pacers]] from [[1997–98 NBA season|1997]] to [[1999-2000 NBA season|2000]]. In 2003, he assumed the role of president of basketball operations for the Pacers, and he held that position until 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.usatoday.com/sports/basketball/nba/pacers/.../larry-bird.../1&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to being part of the [[50–40–90 Club]], he is the only person in NBA history to be named [[Most Valuable Player]], [[NBA Coach of the Year Award|Coach of the Year]], and [[NBA Executive of the Year Award|Executive of the Year]].&lt;ref name=&quot;triple award&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2012/basketball/nba/05/16/larry.bird.pacers.executive.ap/index.html |title=Pacers' Bird named NBA's top exec |publisher=[[CNN Sports Illustrated]] |date=May 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Larry Bird was born in [[West Baden, Indiana]], the son of Georgia (née Kerns) and Claude Joseph &quot;Joe&quot; Bird.&lt;ref name=birdhighschool&gt;{{cite news|last=Remnick|first=David|title=Just a Hick from French Lick|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=uCIfAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=dKcEAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=larry-bird%20parents&amp;pg=2068%2C6119080|accessdate=November 1, 2011|newspaper=The Washington Post / Anchorage Daily News|date=May 27, 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; He grew up in both West Baden and the adjacent town [[French Lick, Indiana|French Lick]], which earned him the nickname &quot;the Hick from French Lick&quot; in his professional basketball career.&lt;ref name=frenchlick&gt;{{cite news|last=Millan|first=Manny|title=NBA Nicknames: Larry Bird|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/multimedia/photo_gallery/0907/nba.nicknames/content.8.html|work=Sports Illustrated|accessdate=November 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bird recalled how his mother would make do on the family's meager earnings: &quot;If there was a payment to the bank due, and we needed shoes, she'd get the shoes, and then deal with them guys at the bank. I don't mean she wouldn't pay the bank, but the children always came first.&quot;&lt;ref name=1988flash&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/basketball/nba/1998/bird/flashbacks/1988flash.html |title=Boston's Larry Bird, in what may be his finest season, gets Red Auerbach's vote—over Bill Russell—as the best ever |work=[[CNNSI.com]] |last=Deford |first=Frank |date=March 21, 1988 |accessdate=May 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bird, his being poor as a child &quot;motivates me to this day&quot;.&lt;ref name=1988flash/&gt; He sometimes was sent to live with his grandmother due to the family's struggles. The Bird family's struggle with poverty was compounded by the alcoholism and personal difficulties of Joe Bird, who likely suffered from [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] from serving in the [[Korean War]].&lt;ref name=&quot;magicbird&quot;/&gt; Joe Bird committed suicide on February 3, 1975, when Larry was 18 years old.&lt;ref&gt;http://espn.go.com/sportscentury/features/00014103.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Bird started for French Lick/West Baden's high school team, [[Springs Valley High School]], where he left as the school's all-time scoring leader.&lt;ref name=&quot;larrybird.com&quot;&gt;http://www.larrybird.com/Biography.aspx/&lt;/ref&gt; Bird's high school coach, Jim Jones, was a key factor to Bird's success. &quot;Jonesie&quot;, as Bird called him, would come help Bird and his friends practice any day of the week.&lt;ref&gt;Bird, Larry (1989), Drive: The Story of My Life. Doubleday, p. 28. ISBN 0-385-24921-7.&lt;/ref&gt; Bird would often go to the gym early, shoot between classes, and stay late into the evening.

==Collegiate career==
Bird received a scholarship to play college basketball for [[Bob Knight]] and the [[Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball|Indiana University Hoosiers]] in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Davis|first=Seth|title=When March Went Mad|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2009/writers/the_bonus/03/03/march.mad/index.html|accessdate=May 17, 2012|newspaper=Sports Illustrated|date=March 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he was overwhelmed by the size of the campus and number of students and was not mentally ready for this stage of life; according to Bird, &quot;it didn't take long to realize that I was out of my cocoon.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;magicbird&quot;/&gt; Bird was also treated poorly by an established IU star, [[Kent Benson]]; as Bird recalled, the other upperclassmen of the team treated him well.&lt;ref&gt;Bird, Larry (1989), Drive: The Story of My Life. Doubleday, p. 35. ISBN 0-385-24921-7&lt;/ref&gt; He dropped out of Indiana after 24 days, disappointing his mother.&lt;ref name=&quot;magicbird&quot;&gt;''Magic &amp; Bird: A Courtship of Rivals''. [[HBO]], 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Bird returned home to French Lick where he enrolled in the nearby [[Northwood Institute]] before dropping out and getting a job with the Street Department (the department picked up garbage, repaired roads, removed snow, mowed lawns, etc.) for a year.&lt;ref&gt;Bird, Larry (1989), Drive: The Story of My Life. Doubleday, pp. 39–40. ISBN 0-385-24921-7&lt;/ref&gt; He played [[AAU basketball]] for Hancock Construction&lt;ref&gt;Bird, Larry (1989), Drive: The Story of My Life. Doubleday, p. 40. ISBN 0-385-24921-7&lt;/ref&gt; and, after that year, decided to enroll at [[Indiana State University]] in [[Terre Haute, Indiana|Terre Haute]], where he was coached by [[Bob King (basketball)|Bob King]].

King suffered a stroke prior to the 1978–79 season and assistant [[Bill Hodges]], who had persuaded Bird to return to college basketball,&lt;ref name=&quot;magicbird&quot;/&gt; was promoted to head coach. Before Bird, the Sycamores had never been to the Division I [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA tournament]];&lt;ref name=&quot;magicbird&quot;/&gt; he led the team to the NCAA championship game in [[1979 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1979]], his senior season, only to lose to the [[Michigan State University]] Spartans, who were led by his future NBA rival, [[Magic Johnson|Earvin &quot;Magic&quot; Johnson]]. The Sycamores finished the season 33–1. That year, Bird won the [[USBWA College Player of the Year]], [[Naismith College Player of the Year|Naismith]] and [[John R. Wooden Award|Wooden Award]]s, given to the year's top male college basketball player. After his three seasons at Indiana State, he left as the fifth-highest scorer in [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] history. Bird finished his collegiate career with an average of 30.3 points per game. In 2007, he was voted as one of the [[Missouri Valley Conference]] men's basketball 50 greatest players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Missouri Valley Conference Recognizes MVC Men's Basketball 50 Greatest Players |url=http://www.mvc-sports.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=7600&amp;ATCLID=806235|date= February 26, 2007|publisher=The Valley|accessdate=August 22, 2010}} {{dead link|date=May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1979–1981: Immediate impact==
The [[Boston Celtics]] selected the 6'9&quot;, 220-pound Bird 6th overall in the [[1978 NBA Draft]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.databasebasketball.com/draft/draftyear.htm?yr=1978&amp;lg=N |title=1978 NBA Draft on Basketballreference.com |publisher=Databasebasketball.com |accessdate=July 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedraftreview.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1476 |title=1978 NBA DRAFT |publisher=TheDraftReview |accessdate=July 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; even though they were uncertain whether he would enter the NBA or remain at Indiana State to play his senior season. Bird ultimately decided to play his final college season, but the Celtics retained their exclusive right to sign him until the [[1979 NBA Draft]], because of the NBA's &quot;junior eligible&quot; rule (allowing a collegiate player to be drafted when the player's original &quot;entering&quot; class was graduating and giving them one calendar year to sign them, even if they went back to college).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f43gQbtVEsk&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly before that deadline, and after bitter contract negotiations, Bird agreed to sign with the Celtics, inking a 5 year $3.25 million contract which made him, at the time, the highest-paid [[rookie]] in the history of the NBA.&lt;ref name=&quot;larrybird.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://books.google.com/books?id=6owRYSf9llMC&amp;lpg=PA57&amp;ots=rjuD-ewKDb&amp;dq=%22junior%20eligibility%22%20rule%20Larry%20Bird&amp;pg=PA57#v=onepage&amp;q=%22junior%20eligibility%22%20rule%20Larry%20Bird&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly afterwards, the NBA draft eligibility rules were changed to prevent teams from drafting players before they were ready to sign.&lt;ref&gt;May, Peter: The Big Three http://books.google.com/books?id=6owRYSf9llMC&amp;pg=PA57&amp;lpg=PA57&amp;dq=%22junior+eligibility%22+rule+Larry+Bird&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=rjuD-ewKDb&amp;sig=k85vba1DLa2l180j21T0HBTBQkk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=qtkFUKu7Eufo6wHj54DhCA&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CFAQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22junior%20eligibility%22%20rule%20Larry%20Bird&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; The rule is called the Bird Collegiate Rule.

Bird's impact on the Celtics was immediate. The Celtics were 29–53 during the [[1978–79 NBA season|1978–79 season]], but with Bird the team improved to 61–21 in the [[1979–80 NBA season|1979–80 season]], posting the league's best regular season record. Bird's collegiate rival, [[Magic Johnson]], also had entered the NBA in 1979, joining the [[Los Angeles Lakers]]. In 1980, despite a strong rookie season from Johnson, Bird was named the league's [[NBA Rookie of the Year Award|Rookie of the Year]] and was voted onto the [[Eastern Conference (NBA)|Eastern Conference]] All-Star team (an honor he would receive for each of his 12 full seasons in the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]]). For the 1980 season, Bird led the Celtics in scoring (21.3 points/game), rebounding (10.4 rebounds/game), steals (143), and minutes played (2,955) and was second in assists (4.5 assists/game) and three-pointers (58). Though Boston was beaten by the more athletic [[Philadelphia 76ers]] in the Eastern Conference finals that year, Bird's addition to the team had renewed the promise of Celtic glory.

Following Bird's first season, the Celtics acquired [[center (basketball)|center]] [[Robert Parish]] and the 3rd pick in the [[1980 NBA Draft]] via a trade with the [[Golden State Warriors]] (in exchange for the 1st and 13th picks in the draft). After the Warriors took [[Joe Barry Carroll]] with the 1st pick and the [[Utah Jazz]] chose [[Darrell Griffith]] second, the Celtics selected [[University of Minnesota]] [[power forward (basketball)|power forward]] [[Kevin McHale (basketball)|Kevin McHale]]. With Bird at [[small forward]], the additions of Parish and McHale gave Boston one of the most formidable frontcourts in the history of the NBA. The three would anchor the Celtics throughout Bird's career.

In his [[1980–81 NBA season|second season]], Bird led the Celtics into the playoffs, where they faced off for a second consecutive year with [[Julius Erving]]'s [[Philadelphia 76ers]]. Bird helped the Celtics overcome a 3–1 deficit by winning the last three games by two, two, and one point margins, propelling them into the [[1981 NBA Finals|NBA Finals]], where they defeated the [[Houston Rockets]] in six games with Bird averaging 15.3 points on .419 shooting, 15.3 rebounds and 7.0 assists per game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/NBA_1981_finals.html|title=1981 NBA Finals Composite Box Score|publisher=basketballreference.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It would be the first of three championships in Bird's career, as well as the first of his five Finals appearances.

{{See also|Lakers–Celtics rivalry}}
The additions of Bird and Johnson rejuvenated the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]], which had suffered from low attendance and minimal television interest through much of the 1970s. Immediately upon their entry into the league, the two players became repeating presences in the NBA Finals. Johnson's Lakers won the championship in [[1980 NBA Finals|1980]], Bird's Celtics captured the NBA title in [[1981 NBA Finals|1981]], and Johnson's Lakers wrested it back in [[1982 NBA Finals|1982]]. Bird and Johnson first dueled in the 1979 NCAA title game; as professional basketball players, they would face off numerous times during the 1980s, including the NBA Finals of [[1984 NBA Finals|1984]], [[1985 NBA Finals|1985]] and [[1987 NBA Finals|1987]]. Lakers versus Celtics, and specifically Bird versus Magic, quickly became one of the greatest rivalries in the history of basketball.

In 1984, the Celtics defeated the Lakers in a seven-game Finals, winning game seven 111–102.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sports.yahoo.com/nba/news?slug=mc-finalshistory061610 |title=Celtics, Lakers feel electricity of Game 7 |last=Spears |first=Marc |date=June 16, 2010 |work=[[Yahoo! Sports]] |accessdate=May 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bird averaged 27.4 points on .484 shooting and 14 rebounds a game during the series,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/NBA_1984_finals.html|title=1984 NBA Finals Composite Box Score|publisher=basketballreference.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; earning the [[Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award|award of Finals Most Valuable Player]] (MVP). Bird was also named the league regular season MVP for that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.basketball-reference.com/awards/awards_1984.html#mvp|title=1983–84 NBA MVP Voting|publisher=basketballreference.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985, however, the Lakers avenged the loss, defeating the Celtics in game 6 of the Finals in the [[Boston Garden]]. In a losing effort against Los Angeles, Bird averaged 23.8 points on .449 shooting, 8.8 rebounds and 5.0 assists per game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/NBA_1985_finals.html|title=1985 NBA Finals Composite Box Score|publisher=basketballreference.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; That year, the NBA again named Bird the league MVP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.basketball-reference.com/awards/awards_1985.html#mvp|title=1984–85 NBA MVP Voting|publisher=basketballreference.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On {{Dts|format=mdy|1985|March|12}}, in a game played between the Celtics and Atlanta Hawks at the [[Lakefront Arena|University of New Orleans Lakefront Arena]] in New Orleans, Louisiana, Bird [[List of National Basketball Association players with most points in a game|scored a career high 60 points]] in a tremendous shooting display.  Bird scored all 19 of his points in the third quarter without the aid of a free throw; instead, he scored on jump shots from 20 feet and out.  Bird scored Boston's last sixteen points in the game.  In the fourth quarter, he made a fadeaway three-point shot while being fouled.  He was not given continuation and the basket was not allowed (instead it was ruled a non-shooting foul and he received two free throws).  Bird's 59th and 60th points were scored on a 17-foot jump shot at the buzzer.  For the game, Bird officially shot 22 of 36 from the field, 1 of 4 from three-point range, and 15 of 16 from the free throw line.

Boston would have another great season the next year, with help from another Hall of Famer, [[Bill Walton]]. Walton, whose up and down career had been plagued by foot injuries, was looking for a team, and after having been turned down by the Lakers called Celtics president and general manager [[Red Auerbach]] in a last-ditch effort to close out his career on an upswing. Because of Walton's reputation for being injury prone, Auerbach was initially unwilling to take a risk on him, but Bird, who happened to be in Auerbach's office at the time of Walton's call, urged him to sign Walton, saying that if Walton felt he was healthy enough to play, it was all Bird needed to hear.

With Walton backing up Kevin McHale and Robert Parish, the Celtics would return to the finals in [[1986 NBA Finals|1986]], albeit not against Johnson and the Lakers, who lost in the Western Conference Finals to the [[Houston Rockets]]. The 1986 Celtic team, which finished the regular season 67–15 and defeated the Rockets in six games, is generally considered to be the best of Bird's career. Bird again was named the Finals' MVP for that year, averaging 24 points on .482 shooting, 9.7 rebounds and 9.5 assists per game for the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/NBA_1986_finals.html |title=1986 NBA Finals Composite Box Score |publisher=basketballreference.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also won his third consecutive league MVP award,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.basketball-reference.com/awards/awards_1986.html#mvp |title=1985–86 NBA MVP Voting |publisher=basketballreference.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; a feat matched only by the great Celtic center [[Bill Russell]] and the dominant [[Wilt Chamberlain]], who played for Philadelphia and Los Angeles.

In 1987, the Celtics made their last Finals appearance of Bird's career, fighting through difficult series against the [[Milwaukee Bucks]] and [[Detroit Pistons]] but as they reached the NBA Finals, the Celtics, hampered by devastating injuries, lost to a dominant Lakers team which had won 65 games during the season. The Celtics ended up losing to the Lakers in six games, with Bird averaging 24.2 points on .445 shooting, 10 rebounds and 5.5 assists per game in the championship series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/NBA_1987_finals.html |title=1987 NBA Finals Composite Box Score|publisher=basketballreference.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Celtics would fall short in 1988 losing to the Pistons in 6 games in the Eastern Conference Finals as the Pistons made up from the heartbreak the previous season. Between them, Bird and Johnson captured eight NBA championships during the 1980s, with Magic getting five and Bird three. During the 1980s, either Boston or Los Angeles appeared in every NBA Finals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.championshiphistory.com/nba.php&amp;nbsp;– Championship History&amp;nbsp;– NBA Championship History]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usatoday.com/sports/basketba/skn/sknd020.htm&amp;nbsp;– NBA Finals history]&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the 1980s, contests between the Celtics and the Lakers—both during the regular season and in the Finals—attracted enormous television audiences. The first regular season game between the Celtics and the Lakers in the 1987–88 season proved to be a classic with [[Magic Johnson]] banking in an off balance shot from near the three-point line at the buzzer for a 115–114 Lakers win at Boston Garden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.basketball-reference.com/fc/pgl.cgi?player=birdla01&amp;year=1988|title=Celtics-Lakers Box Score|publisher=basketballreference.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The historical rift between the teams, which faced each other several times in championship series of the 1960s, fueled fan interest in the rivalry. Not since [[Bill Russell]] squared off against [[Wilt Chamberlain]] had professional basketball enjoyed such a marquee matchup. The apparent contrast between the two players and their respective teams seemed scripted for television: Bird, the introverted small-town hero with the blue-collar work ethic, fit perfectly with the throwback, hard-nosed style of the Celtics, while the stylish, gregarious Johnson ran the Lakers' fast-paced &quot;Showtime&quot; offense amidst the bright lights and celebrities of Los Angeles. A 1980s [[Converse (shoe company)|Converse]] commercial for its &quot;Weapon&quot; line of basketball shoes (endorsed by both Bird and Johnson) reflected the perceived dichotomy between the two players. In the commercial, Bird is practicing alone on a rural basketball court when Johnson pulls up in a sleek [[limousine]] and challenges him to a one-on-one match.

Despite the intensity of their rivalry, Bird and Johnson became friends off the court. Their friendship blossomed when the two players worked together to film the [[Converse (shoe company)|Converse]] commercial, which depicted them as archenemies. Johnson appeared at Bird's retirement ceremony on February 4, 1993 and emotionally described Bird as a &quot;friend forever&quot;.

==1988–1992: Waning years==
{{BLP unsourced section|date=October 2011}}
In 1988, Bird had the best statistical season of his career, but the Celtics failed to reach the NBA Finals for the first time in five years, losing to the Pistons in six games during the Eastern Conference Finals. Bird started the [[1988–89 NBA season|1988–89 season]], but ended his season after six games to have bone spurs surgically removed from both of his heels. He returned to the Celtics in 1989, but debilitating back problems and an aging Celtic roster prevented him from regaining his mid-1980s form. Nonetheless, through the final years of his career, Bird maintained his status as one of the premier players in the game. He averaged over 20 points, 9 rebounds and 7 assists a game in his last three seasons with the Celtics, and shot better than 45% from the field in each. Bird led the Celtics to playoff appearances in each of those three seasons.

Bird's body, however, continued to break down. He had been bothered by back problems for years, and his back became progressively worse. After leading the Celtics to a 29–5 start to the [[1990–91 NBA season|1990–91 season]], he missed 22 games due to a compressed nerve root in his back, a condition that would eventually lead to his retirement. He had off-season surgery to remove a disc from his back, but his back problems continued and he missed 37 games during the [[1991–92 NBA season|1991–92 season]].  His past glory would be briefly rekindled, however, in a game that season in which he scored 49 points in a double-overtime victory over the [[Portland Trail Blazers]]. During the 1992 [[Eastern Conference (NBA)|Eastern Conference]] semi-finals against the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]], Bird missed four of the seven games in the series due to those recurring back problems.


In the summer of 1992, Bird joined [[Magic Johnson]], [[Michael Jordan]] and other NBA stars to play for the United States [[United States men's national basketball team|basketball team]] in that year's [[1992 Summer Olympics|Olympics]] in Barcelona, Spain. It was the first time in America's Olympic history that the country sent professional basketball players to compete. The &quot;[[1992 United States men's Olympic basketball team|Dream Team]]&quot; won the men's basketball gold medal.

Following his Olympic experience, on August 18, 1992, Bird announced his retirement as an [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] player. He finished his career with averages of more than 24 points, 10 rebounds and 6 assists per game, while shooting 49.6% from the field, 88.6% from the free throw line and 37.6% from three-point range. Following Bird's departure, the Celtics promptly retired his jersey number 33.

In 1989, Bird published his autobiography, ''[[Drive: The Story of My Life]]'' with [[Bob Ryan]]. The book chronicles his life and career up to the 1989 NBA season.

==NBA career after retirement==

[[File:Larrybird.jpg|150px|thumb|right|Larry Bird in 2004.]]
[[File:Monumento larry bird.jpg|250px|thumb|left|A Larry Bird Monument.]]
The Celtics employed Bird as a special assistant in the team's front office from 1992 until 1997. In 1997, Bird accepted the position of coach of the [[Indiana Pacers]] and said he would be on the job for no more than three years. Despite having no previous coaching experience, Bird led the Pacers to a 58–24 record—the franchise's best as an NBA team at the time—in the [[1997–98 NBA season|1997–98 season]], and pushed the Bulls to seven games in the Eastern Conference finals.  He was named the [[NBA Coach of the Year Award|NBA Coach of the Year]] for his efforts, becoming the only person in NBA history to have won both the [[NBA MVP|MVP]] and [[NBA Coach of the Year|Coach of the Year]] awards.  He then led the Pacers to two consecutive Central Division titles in [[1998–99 NBA season|1999]] and [[1999-2000 NBA season|2000]], and a berth in the NBA finals in 2000.

Bird resigned as Pacers coach shortly after the end of the 2000 season, following through on his initial promise to coach for only three years. In 2003, he returned as the Pacers' President of Basketball Operations, overseeing team personnel and coaching moves, as well as the team's draft selections.  Bird promoted [[David Morway]] to general manager in 2008, but Bird still had the final say in basketball matters. After the 2011–2012 NBA season, Bird was named [[NBA Executive of the Year]].

On June 27, 2012, a day before the [[2012 NBA Draft]], Bird and the Pacers announced that they would be parting ways later that summer. Bird said health issues were among the reasons for his leaving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Indiana Pacers part ways with Larry Bird|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-400_162-57461784/indiana-pacers-part-ways-with-larry-bird/|publisher=CBS/AP|accessdate=27 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Donnie Walsh]] has been named to replace him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/NBA-Bird-leaves-Pacers-as-Walsh-returns-to-replace-him/articleshow/14440426.cms | title= NBA: Bird leaves Pacers as Walsh returns to replace him

==Legacy==
{{quote|Larry, you only told me one lie. You said there will be another Larry Bird. Larry, there will never, ever be another Larry Bird.|Magic Johnson, as quoted at Bird's retirement party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/history/Classic_NBA_Quotes_Index.html|publisher=NBA |title=Classic NBA Quotes|accessdate=September 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1999, Bird ranked No. 30 in ''[[ESPN]]'s [[SportsCentury#SportsCentury: Top 50 Athletes of the 20th Century (Original series)|SportsCentury's 50 Greatest Athletes of the 20th century]]''.

For the [[2008 NBA Finals]], which featured a rematch of the Celtics-Lakers rivalry, Bird appeared in a split-screen advertisement with Magic Johnson (as part of the &quot;There Can Only Be One&quot; campaign which had played throughout the [[2008 NBA Playoffs]] but to that point only featured players from the two teams competing in a given series) discussing the meaning of rivalries.

Bird was widely considered one of Red Auerbach's favorite players. He considered Bird to be the greatest basketball player of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/basketball/nba/1998/bird/flashbacks/1988flash.html |title=CNN.com |work=Sports Illustrated |date=April 6, 1979 |accessdate=July 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Auerbach was so enamored with the player that he drafted him out of Indiana State and waited a year before Bird was eligible to suit up for the Celtics.  During his introductory press conference, after Auerbach's contentious negotiations with agent Bob Woolf, Bird announced he &quot;would have played for free.&quot;  This was after Woolf asked for the most lucrative contract in NBA history, to which Auerbach was quick to point out that Bird had not played a game in the NBA yet.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

Bird is the only person to be named an MVP, Coach of the Year, and Executive of the Year in the NBA.&lt;ref name=&quot;triple award&quot;/&gt;

==Player profile==
Bird, a versatile wing man who played the power forward and small forward positions, is considered one of the greatest players of all time, to which his twelve All-Star team nominations are a testament. The sharpshooting Bird made his name stepping up his performance in critical situations, and is credited with a long list of dominating games, [[buzzer beater]]s and [[Clutch (sports)|clutch]] defensive plays. He won two NBA Finals MVP and three regular-season MVP awards. He won them all in a row, a feat only shared by [[Bill Russell]] and [[Wilt Chamberlain]].

Bird possessed an uncanny and unparalleled ability to anticipate and react to the strategies of his opponents. His talent for recognizing the moves of opponents and teammates prompted his first coach with the Celtics, [[Bill Fitch]], to nickname him &quot;[[Eastman Kodak|Kodak]]&quot;, because he seemed to formulate mental pictures of every play that took place on the court.

Bird scored 24.3 points per game in his career on a high .496 field goal average, a stellar .886 free throw average (9th best all-time) and a 37.6 percentage on three-point shots. Bird was also a good rebounder (10.0 rebound career average) and an excellent playmaker (6.3 assist career average). His multidimensional game made him a consistent [[triple-double]] threat; Bird currently ranks fifth all-time in [[triple-double]]s with 59, not including the 10 he recorded in the playoffs. Bird's lifetime [[player efficiency rating]] (PER) is 23.5, 18th all-time, a further testament to his all around game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/PER_career.html |title=Career Leaders and Records for Player Efficiency Rating&amp;nbsp;– |publisher=Basketball-reference.com |accessdate=July 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, he is the only 20, 10, 5 player in NBA history (points, rebounds, assists per game) with a lifetime PRA rating (points + rebounds + assists per game) of 40.6, which is 8th all-time.  Bird was the first player in NBA history to shoot 50% or better on field goals, 40% on three-pointers, and 90% on free-throws in a single NBA season while achieving the league minimum for makes in each category. Bird accomplished this feat twice and is second only to [[Steve Nash]] for seasons in the [[50-40-90 Club (NBA)|50–40–90 Club]].

Bird is also remembered as an excellent defender. While he was neither fast nor quick-footed, and could not always shut down an individual player one-on-one, he consistently displayed a knack for anticipating the moves of his opponent, allowing him to intercept passes and create turnovers. His 1,556 career steals ranks 27th all-time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/STL_career.html |title=Career Leaders and Records for Steals&amp;nbsp;– |publisher=Basketball-reference.com |accessdate=July 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unspectacular but effective defensive moves, such as jumping into a passing lane to make a steal or allowing his man to step past and drive to the hoop, then blocking the opponent's shot from behind, were staples of Bird's defensive game. In recognition of his defensive abilities, Bird was named to three All-Defensive Second Teams.

Bird's humble roots were the source of his most frequently used moniker, &quot;The Hick From French Lick&quot;. Other observers called him &quot;The Great White Hope&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;magicbird&quot;/&gt; He has also acquired the nickname &quot;Larry Legend&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nba.com/history/players/bird_summary.html |title=NBA.com: Larry Bird Summary |accessdate=June 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bird's competitive nature often emerged in nearly constant [[trash-talk]]ing on the court. Some notable examples follow:
* During the three-point shooting contest on All-Star Weekend 1986, Bird entered the locker room, looked around without saying a word, then finally said, &quot;I want all of you to know I am winning this thing.  I'm just looking around to see who's gonna finish up second.&quot; He won the shooting contest.
* During one game on Christmas Day against the Indiana Pacers, before the game Bird told [[Chuck Person]] that he had a Christmas present waiting for him. During the game, when Person was on the bench, Bird shot a three-pointer on the baseline right in front of Person. Immediately after releasing the ball, Bird said to Person, &quot;Merry f*%#ing Christmas!&quot;, and then the shot went in.  This was no doubt inspired by Person (nicknamed the &quot;Rifleman&quot;) stating prior to the game that &quot;The Rifleman is Coming, and He's Going Bird Hunting.&quot;
* [[Reggie Miller]] recalled his encounter with Larry Bird's legendary trash talking ability in his book ''I Love Being the Enemy''. Reggie tried to disrupt Larry's concentration when he was shooting free throws late in a game. Larry glared at him, made the first free throw and said, &quot;You got to be kidding me. Rook, I'm the best shooter in the league right now. In the league. Understand? And you're up here trying to say something?&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;MillerWojciechowski1999&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author1=Reggie Miller |author2=Gene Wojciechowski |author3=Spike Lee |title=I Love Being the Enemy: A Season on the Court with the NBA's Best Shooter and Sharpest Tongue |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=5TKlQTvQzxEC |accessdate=June 28, 2011 |date=April 1, 1999 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |isbn=978-0-684-87039-7 |page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then Larry buried the second free throw.
* Late in a tied game against the [[Seattle SuperSonics]], Bird told Supersonics forward [[Xavier McDaniel]], who was guarding him, “I’m going to get [the ball] right here and I am going to bury it in your face.”  As McDaniel remembers it, he responded by saying, “I know, I’ll be waiting.”  After a timeout, Bird made two baseline cuts, then posted in the exact spot he had indicated to McDaniel, paused, turned, and made it in his face.  He finished up the sequence by telling McDaniel, “I didn’t mean to leave two seconds on the [[shot clock|clock]].”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nba.com/news/birdat50.html |title=Happy 50th, Larry Legend |publisher=NBA  |accessdate=July 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.4sportboston.com/2010/03/if-only-larry-bird-was-walking-through-that-door/ |last=Winkel |first=Stew |title=If Only Larry Bird Was Walking Through That Door |date= March 17, 2010 |work=4sportboston.com |accessdate=May 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On November 9, 1984, Bird was ejected along with [[Julius Erving]] in the third quarter after an on court scuffle. At the point of both ejections, Bird had outscored Erving 42 to 6. During the game, Bird had continuously informed Erving of their tallies with every chance he got to score. Bird denies this stating that it was teammate &quot;[[M.L. Carr|M.L. (Carr)]] talking trash from the bench&quot; during that game.&lt;ref&gt;Bird, Larry (1989), Drive: The Story of My Life. Doubleday, p. 87. ISBN 0-385-24921-7&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually a shoving match ensued, then swings taken by both players, and finally a bench-clearing brawl.

* Bird's likeness has appeared in several video games. In ''[[One on One: Dr. J vs. Larry Bird]]'', Bird plays opposite Julius Erving in a game of one-on-one. A sequel, ''[[Jordan vs Bird: One on One]]'', was a 1988 basketball video game. In 2011, Bird was featured on the cover of ''[[NBA 2K12]]'', alongside [[Magic Johnson]] and [[Michael Jordan]]. Bird is also playable character in the revamped ''[[NBA Jam (2010 video game)|NBA Jam]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kotaku.com/5638224/your-nba-jam-rosters-are-set Kotaku&amp;nbsp;– NBA Jam Rosters Are Set]&lt;/ref&gt;

* In a phone commercial when Larry Bird tells [[Tweety Bird]] that they are not related, Tweety not only comments on them having the same last name but that they &quot;look an awful lot alike&quot;.
* Larry Bird and [[Magic Johnson]] wrote a book together (with [[Jackie MacMullan]]) titled ''When The Game Was Ours''.
* In a commercial during [[Super Bowl XLIV]], [[Dwight Howard]] and [[LeBron James]] challenge each other at trick shots for a [[McDonald's]] lunch. After they finish, clapping is heard, then the camera pans to the crowd and Bird says &quot;Great show, guys. Thanks for lunch.&quot; Howard and James share a confused look. Howard asks, &quot;Who was that?&quot; James replies, &quot;I have no idea.&quot; This refers to a McDonald's commercial from 1991 in which Bird and Michael Jordan have a trick shot contest, in which the winner got the lunch and the loser had to watch the winner eat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=FULL VERSION: McDonald's Commercial with LeBron James and Dwight Howard |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmrTDZy3f2M |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=April 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In October 2005, a man in [[Oklahoma City]], Eric James Torpy, was convicted of shooting with intent to kill and robbery.

The '''ogonek''' (Polish {{IPAc-pl|o|'|g|o|n|e|k}}, &quot;little tail&quot;, the [[diminutive]] of ''ogon''; [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] ''nosinė'') is a [[diacritic]] hook placed under the lower right corner of a vowel in the [[Latin alphabet]] used in several European and Native American languages.

==Values==
===Nasalization===
The use of the ogonek to indicate [[nasal vowel|nasality]] is common in the transcription of the [[indigenous languages of the Americas]]. This usage originated in the orthographies created by Christian missionaries to transcribe these languages. Later, the practice was continued by Americanist anthropologists and linguists who still follow this convention in phonetic transcription to the present day (see [[Americanist phonetic notation]]).

The ogonek is also used in academic transliteration of [[Old Church Slavonic language|Old Church Slavonic]]. In Polish, Old Church Slavonic, Navajo, Western Apache, Chiricahua, and [[Dalecarlian language|Dalecarlian]] it indicates that the vowel is nasalized&lt;!-- in Tutchone too ? --&gt;. Even if ''ę'' is nasalized ''e'' in Polish, ''ą'' is nasalized ''o'' not ''a'' (this is so because of the vowel change — &quot;ą&quot; was a long nasal &quot;a&quot;, which turned into short nasal &quot;o&quot;, when the vowel quantity distinction disappeared).

===Length===
In Lithuanian, it formerly indicated nasalization but is no longer distinctive and indicates that a vowel is [[long vowel|long]]. The Lithuanian word for &quot;ogonek&quot; is ''nosinė'', which literally means &quot;nasal&quot;.

=== Openness ===
In [[Rheinische Dokumenta]], it marks [[vowel]]s which are more [[open vowel|open]] than those denoted by their base letters Ää, Oo, Öö. Here it can be combined with [[Trema (diacritic)|umlaut]] marks in two cases.

==Similar diacritics==
===E caudata and o caudata===
The ''[[E caudata]]'' (''ę''), a symbol similar to an ''e'' with ogonek, evolved from a [[ligature (typography)|ligature]] of ''a'' and ''e'' in medieval scripts, in [[Latin]] and [[Irish language|Irish]] [[palaeography]].  The ''[[O caudata]]'' of [[Old Norse]]&lt;ref&gt;For this traditional and correct name, see e.g. [[Einar Haugen]] (ed. and trans.), ''[[First Grammatical Treatise]]'', 2nd edition, Longman, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; (letter ''{{Unicode|ǫ}}'', with ''{{Unicode|ǭ}}''/''{{Unicode|ǫ́}}'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unicode.org/charts/nameslist/n_0180.html |title=Non-European and historic Latin |publisher= [[Unicode Consortium]] |date= |accessdate=2011-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://kodeks.uni-bamberg.de/slavling/downloads/SK_Slavic_Unicode_I.pdf ''Unicode 4.1 and Slavic Philology Problems and Perspectives (I)''] by Sebastian Kempgen, University of Bamberg, Germany&lt;/ref&gt; is used to write the [[open-mid back rounded vowel]], {{IPA|/ɔ/}}.  Medieval Nordic manuscripts show this &quot;hook&quot; in both directions, in combination with several vowels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gandalf.aksis.uib.no/mufi/proposal/range2F-v2.html |title=Medieval Unicode Font Initiative |publisher=Gandalf.aksis.uib.no |date=2003-02-05 |accessdate=2011-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite this distinction, the term &quot;ogonek&quot; is sometimes used in discussions of typesetting and encoding Norse texts, as ''o caudata'' is typographically identical to o with ogonek.

===Cedilla and comma===
The ogonek is functionally equivalent to the [[cedilla]] and [[Comma (diacritic)|comma]] diacritics. If two of these three are used within the same orthography their respective use is restricted to certain classes of letters, i.e. usually the ogonek is used with vowels whereas the cedilla is applied to consonants. In handwritten text the marks may even look the same.

==Typographical notes==
[[File:Ogonek-european-natamerican.svg|thumb|right|Difference between the correct placement of the ogonek in European languages (left) and Native American languages (right)]]

The ogonek should be almost the same size as a [[descender]] (in larger type sizes may be relatively quite shorter) and should not be confused with the [[cedilla]] or [[Comma (punctuation)|comma]] [[diacritic marks]] used in other languages.

When used for Native American languages, the ogonek should be placed directly under the letter rather than to the side as is the norm for European languages. European-style placement is acceptable when no other alternatives are available.

The '''Great Dividing Range''', or the '''Eastern Highlands''', is [[Australia]]'s most substantial mountain range and the [[List of mountain ranges#By length|third longest in the world]].&lt;ref&gt;The Great Dividing Range is the third longest mountain range of mountain ranges above sea level. Technically, the mid-ocean ridge is the longest of the world's mountain ranges.&lt;/ref&gt; The range stretches more than {{convert|3500|km|mi|0}} from [[Dauan Island, Queensland|Dauan Island]] off the northeastern tip of Queensland, running the entire length of the eastern coastline through [[New South Wales]], then into [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and turning west, before finally fading into the central plain at the [[Grampian Mountains (Australia)|Grampians]] in western Victoria. The width of the range varies from about {{convert|160|km|mi|abbr=on|-1}} to over {{convert|300|km|mi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shaw&quot;&gt;Shaw, John H., “Collins Australian Encyclopedia”, William Collins Pty Ltd., Sydney, 1984, ISBN 0-00-217315-8&lt;/ref&gt;

The sharp rise between the coastal lowlands and the eastern uplands has affected Australia's climate, mainly due to [[Precipitation (meteorology)#Orographic effects|orographic precipitation]], and these areas of highest relief have revealed an impressive gorge country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Löffler |first=Ernst |authorlink= |coauthors=A.J. Rose, Anneliese Löffler &amp; Denis Warner |title=Australia:Portrait of a Continent |year=1983 |publisher=Hutchinson Group |location=Richmond, Victoria |isbn=0-09-130460-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
[[Image:Topography of australia.jpg|thumb|right|The Great Divide dominates the eastern Australia landmass]]

The Dividing Range does not consist of a single mountain range. It consists of a complex of mountain ranges, plateaus, upland areas and escarpments with an ancient and complex geological history. The physiographic division name for the landmass is called the ''East Australian Cordillera''. In some places the terrain is relatively flat, consisting of very low hills.&lt;ref name=&quot;goa&quot;/&gt;

The crest of the range is defined by the [[drainage divide|watershed]] or boundary between the [[drainage basin]]s of rivers which drain directly eastward into the Pacific Ocean, or southward into [[Bass Strait]], and those rivers which drain into the [[Murray-Darling river|Murray-Darling River system]] towards the west and south.&lt;ref name=&quot;goa&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=The Geology of Australia |last=Johnson |first=David |year=2009 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0521767415 |page=202 |accessdate=10 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the north, the rivers on the west side of the range drain towards the [[Gulf of Carpentaria]].

The higher and more rugged parts of the &quot;range&quot; do not necessarily form part of the crest of the range, but may be branches and offshoots from it. The term &quot;Great Dividing Range&quot; may refer specifically to the watershed crest of the range, or to the entire upland complex including all of the hills and mountains between the east coast of Australia and the central plains and lowlands.  At some places it can be up to 400 km wide.&lt;ref name=&quot;goa&quot;/&gt; Notable ranges and other features which form part of the range complex have their own distinctive names.

==History==
The Great Dividing Range was formed during the [[Carboniferous|Carboniferous period]]—some 300 million years ago—when Australia collided with what is now parts of South America and New Zealand. The range has experienced significant erosion since. (See [[Geology of Australia]].)

Prior to white settlement the ranges were home to [[Australian Aborigines|Australian Aboriginal]] tribes. Evidence remains in some places of their occupation by decorated caves, campsites and trails used to travel between the coastal and inland regions.

After European settlement in 1788, the ranges were an obstacle to exploration and settlement by the British settlers. Although not high, parts of the highlands were very rugged. Crossing the [[Blue Mountains (Australia)|Blue Mountains]] was particularly challenging due to the almost impenetrable, labyrinth, sandstone mountains.&lt;ref name=&quot;cgr&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://australia.gov.au/about-australia/australian-story/crossing-the-great-dividing-range |title=Crossing the Great Dividing Range—surveying an ancient land |date=10 December 2008 |work=About Australia |publisher=Australian Government |accessdate=19 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1813, a usable route was finally discovered directly westward from Sydney across the Blue Mountains to [[Bathurst, New South Wales|Bathurst]] by the party of [[Gregory Blaxland]], which included [[William Lawson (explorer)|William Lawson]] and [[William Wentworth|William Charles Wentworth]]. They found a passage by following the top of a ridge.&lt;ref name=&quot;cgr&quot;/&gt;  Towns in the Blue Mountains were later named after each of these men. This was the start of the development of the agricultural districts of inland [[New South Wales]]. A road was built to [[Blaxland, New South Wales|Blaxland]] by convicts within six months. Easier routes to inland New South Wales were discovered towards [[Goulburn]] to the southwest, and westwards from [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]].

Subsequent explorations were made across and around the ranges by [[Allan Cunningham (botanist)|Allan Cunningham]], [[John Oxley]], [[Hamilton Hume]], [[Paul Edmund Strzelecki]], [[Ludwig Leichhardt]] and [[Thomas Mitchell (explorer)|Thomas Mitchell]]. These explorers were mainly concerned with finding good agricultural land.

By the late 1830s the most fertile rangelands adjacent to the mountains ranges had been explored and some settled. These included the Gippsland and Riverina regions in the south, up to the [[Liverpool Plains]] and the [[Darling Downs]] in the north.

Various road and railway routes were subsequently established through many parts of the ranges, although many areas remain remote to this day. For example, in eastern Victoria there is only one major road crossing the highlands from north to south.
[[Image:GreatDividingRangeSign.jpg|thumb|right|Great Dividing Range sign on the [[Kings Highway, Australia|Kings Highway]] between [[Braidwood, New South Wales|Braidwood]] and [[Bungendore, New South Wales|Bungendore]], [[New South Wales]]]]

==Notable components==
Parts of the highlands consisting of relatively flat and, by Australian standards, well-watered land were developed for agricultural and pastoral uses. Such areas include the [[Atherton Tableland]] and [[Darling Downs]] in Queensland, and the [[Northern Tablelands]], [[Southern Highlands, New South Wales|Southern Highlands]] and [[Southern Tablelands]] in [[New South Wales]]. Other parts of the highlands are too rugged for agriculture and have been used for forestry.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} Many parts of the highlands which were not developed are now included in [[National Parks]].

All of [[Australia (continent)|mainland Australia]]'s alpine areas, including its highest mountain, [[Mount Kosciuszko]] (2,228 metres [[Australian Height Datum|AHD]]), are part of this range.&lt;ref name=&quot;goa&quot;/&gt; The highest areas in southern New South Wales and eastern Victoria are known as the [[Australian Alps]].

The central core of the Great Dividing Range is dotted with hundreds of peaks and is surrounded by many smaller mountain ranges or spurs, [[canyon]]s, [[valley]]s and plains of regional significance.  Some of the major plains include the [[High Plains (Australia)|High Plains]] of South-Eastern Australia, the Southern Highlands the [[Central highlands (Victoria)|Central highlands]] and [[Bogong High Plains]] of Victoria. Other tablelands considered part of the Great dividing range are the [[Atherton Tableland]], [[Canberra wine region]] and the [[Southern Tablelands]].
[[Image:Worldwind-SnowyMountains.jpg|thumb|left|The Snowy Mountains alpine region]]

The [[Dandenong Ranges]], [[Barrington Tops]], [[Bunya Mountains]], [[Blue Mountains (Australia)|Blue Mountains]], [[Liverpool Range]], [[McPherson Range]]s and the [[Moonbi Range]] are some of the smaller spurs and ranges that make up the greater dividing range. Other notable ranges and tablelands which form part of the Great Dividing Range include the [[Liverpool Range]], [[Mount Royal Range]] and the [[Monaro, New South Wales|Monaro District]]. Whilst some of the peaks of the highlands reach respectable heights of a little over 2,000 metres, the age of the range and its erosion mean that most of the mountains are not very steep, and virtually all peaks can be reached without mountaineering equipment.

In some areas, such as the [[Snowy Mountains]], [[Victorian Alps]], the [[Scenic Rim]] and the eastern escarpments of the [[New England (Australia)|New England]] region, the highlands form a significant barrier. The eastern escarpment is the site of many spectacular waterfalls which were formed by rivers plunging off the tablelands. In other areas the slopes are gentle and in places the range is barely perceptible.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shaw&quot;/&gt;

Well known passes on the range include [[Coxs Gap]], [[Cunninghams Gap]], [[Dead Horse Gap]], [[Nowlands Gap]], and [[Spicers Gap]].
[[Image:Benambra&amp;OmeoPlains-from-MtBlowhard.jpg|thumb|320 px|right|[[Omeo, Victoria|Omeo]] Plains from Mount Blowhard]]

Notable towns located on the upland areas of the range include [[Atherton, Queensland|Atherton]], [[Toowoomba, Queensland|Toowoomba]], [[Armidale, New South Wales|Armidale]], [[Oberon, New South Wales|Oberon]], [[Goulburn, New South Wales|Goulburn]], [[Canberra]], [[Walcha, New South Wales|Walcha]] and [[Omeo, Victoria|Omeo]]. Many other towns and cities are located in lowland areas and foothills adjacent to the highlands. There is a strong natural history and cultural attachment to the Dividing Range region in towns and on many, sometimes remote landholdings.

===Water catchments===
[[File:Dangar Falls Dorrigo (1).JPG|left|thumb|Some of the most spectacular waterfalls in Australia, such as Dangar Falls at [[Dorrigo, New South Wales]] are located along the Great Dividing Range.]]

The lower reaches are used for forestry, an activity that causes friction with conservationists. The ranges is also the source of virtually all of eastern Australia's water supply, both through runoff caught in dams, and throughout much of Queensland, through the [[Great Artesian Basin]].

Valleys along the chain of mountains have yielded a water source for important reservoirs and water supply projects such as the [[Upper Nepean Scheme]], [[Snowy Mountains Scheme]] and [[Warragamba Dam]]. The [[Bradfield Scheme]] has been mooted as a way to transport water from the tropics in coastal Queensland south to dryer regions.

The Great Dividing Range creates the [[drainage basin]]s of the [[Australian south-east coast drainage division]] and the [[Australian north-east coast drainage division]], whose water flows to [[East Coast of Australia|the east coast]] and into the Pacific Ocean, [[Tasman Sea]], and [[Bass Strait]] with the westerly [[Murray-Darling Basin]] which flow inland, away from the coast into the interior plains.

Some of the rivers which flow west of the ranges includes the [[Condamine River]], [[Flinders River]], [[Herbert River]], [[Lachlan River]], [[Macdonald River (Bendemeer)|Macdonald River]], [[Macintyre River]] and [[Namoi River]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AustraliDotGovDotAu&quot;/&gt; Rivers that flow north into the Murray-Darling Basin from Victoria include the Goulburn, Mitta Mitta, Kiewa, Ovens. King, Loddon and Campaspe rivers. Rivers that flow east into the Pacific Ocean include the [[Brisbane River]], [[Burdekin River]], [[Clarence River (New South Wales)|Clarence River]], [[Hastings River]], [[Hawkesbury River]], [[Hunter River (New South Wales)|Hunter River]], [[Macleay River]], [[Mary River (Queensland)|Mary River]], [[Richmond River]], [[Shoalhaven River]] and the [[Snowy River]]. Those that flow south to the ocean in Victoria include the Snowy, Cann, Tambo, Mitchell, Latrobe, Thomson, Yarra, Werribee, Hopkins and Glenelg rivers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shaw&quot;/&gt;

==Features==
At some high hill passes the range provides cool sites appropriate for [[vineyard]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;nwa&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=New Wine Atlas: Wines and Wine Regions of the World |last=Clarke |first=Oz |authorlink=Oz Clarke |year=2002 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |isbn=0-15-100913-9 |page=300 |url=http://books.google.com.au/books?id=nSoxj_3e89MC |accessdate=18 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Railways===
[[Image:Katoomba scenic railway track 1.jpg|thumb|right|A number of scenic railways, such as this one at [[Katoomba, New South Wales|Katoomba]], climb various shorter routes along the range]]
The engineers of early rail passages across the Great Dividing Range needed to find low sections of the range to cross, as well as suitable, low gradient paths up the mountains on either side. Rail passages include:
*Ipswich-Toowoomba (1867)
*[[Main North railway line, New South Wales|Newcastle-Tamworth]] (c1870) – summit at [[Ardglen Tunnel]]
*[[Main Western railway line, New South Wales|Sydney-Lithgow]] (1869), crossing the range via the [[Blue Mountains (Australia)|Blue Mountains]]
*[[Main Southern railway line, New South Wales|Sydney-Goulburn]] (1869), though the divide is actually a few kilometres further west near the crossing with Parkesbourne Road. The next 300&amp;nbsp;km descending to Wagga Wagga is particularly curvy.
*[[North East railway line|Melbourne-Seymour]], crossing the range near [[Heathcote Junction railway station, Victoria|Heathcote Junction]] (1872)
*[[Bendigo railway line|Melbourne-Bendigo]], crossing the range near [[Woodend, Victoria|Woodend]] (1862)
*[[Serviceton railway line|Melbourne-Ararat]] (1875) via [[Ballarat, Victoria|Ballarat]]

===Road transport===
Many of Australia's [[Highways in Australia|highways]] such as the [[Alpine Way]], [[Great Alpine Road]], [[Hume Highway]], [[Great Western Highway]], [[Capricorn Highway]], [[Cunningham Highway]], [[New England Highway]], [[Oxley Highway]], [[Warrego Highway]], [[Waterfall Way]], [[Thunderbolts Way]], the [[Calder Highway]], the [[Western Highway]], and the [[Murray Valley Highway]] traverse parts of the range.

===Protected areas===
Much of the range lies within a succession of [[national park]]s and other [[Protected areas of Australia|reserves]], most of the national parks are listed below, there are almost double the amount of state forests;&lt;ref&gt;''Melway'', Edition 35 2008, Touring Maps&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Brisway'', Edition 1, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Fragaria''''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|f|r|ə|ˈ|ɡ|ɛər|i|ə}})&lt;ref&gt;''Sunset Western Garden Book,'' 1995:606–607&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[genus]] of [[flowering plant]]s in the [[rose]] family, [[Rosaceae]], commonly known as '''strawberries''' for their edible [[fruit]]s. Although it is commonly thought that strawberries get their name from straw being used as a [[mulch]] in cultivating the plants, the etymology of the word is uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.snopes.com/language/notthink/strawberry.asp&lt;/ref&gt; There are more than 20 described [[species]] and many [[Hybrid plant|hybrids]] and [[cultivar]]s. The most common strawberries grown commercially are cultivars of the [[garden strawberry]], a hybrid known as ''Fragaria'' × ''ananassa''&lt;!--N.B. Editors please keep multiplication sign outside quote marks, otherwise it appears italicised on certain browsers--&gt;. Strawberries have a taste that varies by cultivar, and ranges from quite sweet to rather tart. Strawberries are an important commercial fruit crop, widely grown in all temperate regions of the world.

==Description==
Strawberries are not true berries.&lt;ref name=Esau&gt;Esau, K. 1977. ''Anatomy of seed plants''. John Wiley and Sons, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; The fleshy and edible part of the fruit is a [[receptacle (botany)|receptacle]], and the parts that are sometimes mistakenly called &quot;seeds&quot; are [[achene]]s.&lt;ref name=Esau/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E-Flora BC: Electronic Atlas of the Plants of British Columbia: [http://linnet.geog.ubc.ca/Atlas/Atlas.aspx?sciname=Fragaria%20virginiana ''Fragaria virginiana''].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
There are more than 20 different ''Fragaria'' species worldwide. Numbers of other species have been proposed, some of which are now recognized as subspecies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ars-grin.gov/cgi-bin/npgs/html/tax_search.pl?Fragaria USDA GRIN Taxonomy Database] Listing of ''Fragaria'' species&lt;/ref&gt; Key to the classification of strawberry species is recognizing that they vary in the number of [[chromosome]]s. There are seven basic ''types'' of chromosomes that they all have in common. However, they exhibit different [[polyploidy]]. Some species are diploid, having two sets of the seven chromosomes (14 chromosomes total). Others are tetraploid (four sets, 28 chromosomes total), hexaploid (six sets, 42 chromosomes total), octoploid (eight sets, 56 chromosomes total), or decaploid (ten sets, 70 chromosomes total).

As a rough rule (with exceptions), strawberry species with more chromosomes tend to be more robust and produce larger plants with larger berries.&lt;ref&gt;Darrow, George M. ''The Strawberry: History, Breeding and Physiology''. New York. Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1966. [http://www.nal.usda.gov/pgdic/Strawberry/darpubs.htm online text]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Shellfish''' is a [[culinary]] and [[fisheries]] term for [[exoskeleton]]-bearing aquatic [[invertebrate]]s used as [[food]], including various species of [[Mollusca|mollusc]]s, [[crustacean]]s, and [[echinoderm]]s. Although most kinds of shellfish are harvested from [[Seawater|saltwater]] environments, some kinds are found only in [[freshwater]]. In addition a few species of land crabs are eaten, for example ''[[Cardisoma guanhumi]]'' in the [[Caribbean]]. 

Despite the name, shellfish are not a kind of [[fish]], but are simply animals that live in water.  Many varieties of shellfish ([[crustacean]]s in particular) are actually closely related to insects and arachnids, making up one of the main classes of the phylum [[Arthropoda]]. [[Cephalopods]] (squid, octopus, cuttlefish) and [[bivalves]] (clams, oysters) are [[mollusc]]s, as are snails and slugs.

Familiar marine molluscs enjoyed as a food source by humans include many [[species]] of [[clam]]s, [[mussel]]s, [[oyster]]s, [[Periwinkle (mollusc)|winkle]]s, and [[scallop]]s. Some crustaceans commonly eaten are [[shrimp]], [[prawn]], [[lobster]], [[crayfish]], and [[crab]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Shellfish climbs up the popularity ladder; the category is gaining chefs' attention for one-of-a-kind signature menu items | url = http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-85675992.html | publisher = HighBeam Research | accessdate = 2009-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Echinoderm]]s are not as frequently harvested for food as molluscs and crustaceans, however [[sea urchin]] [[roe]] is quite popular in many parts of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Sea urchin makes waves, popularity increases on American menus | url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3190/is_n34_v32/ai_21072930/ | publisher = [[Nation's Restaurant News]] via [[BNET]] | accessdate = 2009-08-25 | first=Florence | last=Fabricant | year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = The sea urchin market in Japan | url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3089/is_n3_v51/ai_9071424/ | publisher = ''Marine Fisheries Review'' via [[BNET]] | accessdate = 2009-08-25 | year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most shellfish eat a diet composed primarily of [[phytoplankton]] and [[zooplankton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Manual on the Production and Use of Live Food for Aquaculture | url = http://www.fao.org/docrep/003/W3732E/w3732e02.htm  | publisher = [[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]] | accessdate = 2009-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shellfish are among the most common [[food allergy|food allergens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Shellfish Alergies | url = http://my.clevelandclinic.org/disorders/shellfish_allergies/hic_shellfish_allergies.aspx | publisher = [[Cleveland Clinic]] | accessdate = 2009-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
[[Image:Rheinische Muscheln.jpg |thumb|180px|right|Cooked [[mussel]]s]]The term ''shellfish'' is used both broadly and specifically. In common parlance, as in having &quot;shellfish&quot; for dinner, it can refer to anything from clams and oysters to lobster and shrimp. For regulatory purposes it is often narrowly defined as ''filter-feeding [[molluscs]]'' such as clams, mussels, and oyster to the exclusion of [[crustacean]]s and all else.&lt;ref&gt;[http://textonly.mde.state.md.us/CitizensInfoCenter/FishandShellfish/harvesting_notices/index.asp Maryland Shellfish Harvesting Areas], Maryland Department of the Environment&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the term is primarily applied to [[Marine (ocean)|marine]] species, edible [[freshwater]] invertebrates such as [[crayfish]] and river [[mussels]] are also sometimes grouped under the umbrella of &quot;shellfish&quot;.

Although their shells may differ, all shellfish are invertebrates.  As non-mammalian animals that spend their entire lives in water they are &quot;fish&quot; in the logical sense; however the denotion ''finfish'' (or ''finnicle fish'') has been developed to distinguish [[fish]] as animals ''defined by having [[vertebrate|vertebrae]]'' from shellfish in modern terminology.

The word &quot;shellfish&quot; is both singular and plural; the rarely used &quot;shellfishes&quot; is sometimes employed to distinguish among various types of shellfish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Fishermen: A Community living from the Sea | page=119 | last1=Festing | first1=Sally | last2=Tyas | first2=Shaun | year=1999 | publisher=Stamford | isbn=978-1-900289-22-1 | edition=Revised}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shellfish in various cuisines==
Archaeological finds has shown that humans have been making use of shellfish as a food item for hundreds of thousands of years. In the present, shellfish dishes are a feature of almost all the [[cuisine]]s of the world,  providing an important source of protein in many cuisines around the world, especially in the countries with coastal areas.

[[Image:Sakura ebi.jpg |thumb|180px|Sakura ebi]]
===In Japan===
In the [[Japanese cuisine]], chefs often use shellfish and their [[roe]] in different dishes. [[Sushi]] (vinegared rice, topped with other ingredients, including shellfish, fish, meat and vegetables), feature both raw and cooked shellfish.  [[Sashimi]] primarily consists of very fresh raw seafood, sliced into thin pieces. Both sushi and sashimi are served with soy sauce and [[wasabi]] paste (a Japanese [[horseradish]] root, a spice with extremely strong hot flavor), thinly-sliced pickled ginger root, and a simple garnish such as [[Perilla|shiso]] (a kitchen herb, member of the [[Mentha|mint]] family) or finely shredded daikon radish, or both.

===In the United States===
[[Image:Boiled Maine Lobster.jpg|thumb|180px|left|Boiled Maine Lobster]]
[[Lobster]] in particular is a great delicacy in the [[United States]], where families in the Northeast region make them into the centerpiece of a [[New England clam bake|clam bake]], usually for special occasions. Lobsters are eaten on much of the East Coast; the [[American lobster]] ranges from [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] down to about the [[Carolinas]], but is most often associated with [[Maine]]. A typical meal involves boiling the lobster with some slight seasoning and then serving it with drawn butter, [[baked potato]], and [[corn on the cob]].

[[Clam digging|Clamming]] is done both commercially and recreationally along the Northeast coastline of the US. Various type of clams are incorporated into the [[cuisine of New England]]. The soft-shelled clam is eaten either [[Fried clam|fried]] or [[New England Clam Boil|steamed]] (and then called &quot;[[soft-shell Clam|steamers]]&quot;). Many types of clams can be used for [[clam chowder]], but the [[quahog]], a hard shelled clam also known as a chowder clam, is often used because the long cooking time softens its tougher meat.

The [[Chesapeake Bay]] and [[Maryland]] region has generally been associated more with crabs, but in recent years the area has been trying to reduce its catch of [[Callinectes sapidus|blue crabs]], as wild populations have been depleted.  This has not, however, stemmed the demand: Maryland-style [[crabcake]]s are still a well known treat in crabhouses all over the bay, though the catch now comes from points farther south.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

[[Image:Zoo 09 bg 120306.jpg|thumb|right|[[Scallop]] sandwich served in San Diego]]
In the [[Southeastern United States|Southeast]], and particularly the gulf states, [[shrimping]] is an important industry. Copious amounts of shrimp are harvested each year in the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to satisfy a national demand for shrimp. Locally, prawns and shrimp are often deep fried; in the Cajun and Creole kitchens of [[Louisiana]], shrimp and prawns are a common addition to traditional recipes like [[jambalaya]] and certain stews. [[Crayfish]] are a well known and much eaten delicacy here, often boiled in huge pots and heavily spiced.

In many major cities with active fishing ports, raw oyster bars are also a feature of shellfish consumption. When served freshly shucked (opened) and iced, one may find a liquid inside the shell, called the liqueur. Some believe that oysters have the properties of an [[aphrodisiac]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Inter-tidal herbivorous shellfish such as mussels and clams can help people reach a healthy balance of [[Omega-3 fatty acid|omega-3]] and omega-6 fats in their diets, instead of the current [[Western diets]].&lt;ref&gt;Robson, A. 2006. &quot;[http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/4441002d Shellfish view of omega-3 and sustainable fisheries].&quot; Nature 444, 1002.&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, the eating of shellfish is often encouraged by dietitians.
Shellfish, however, are a rich source of the amino acid taurine.

==Around the world==

[[Image:Cooked Snail Found In Rajang River.jpg|thumb|200px|A dish of cooked freshwater [[Neritidae|nerites]] from the [[Rajang River]], [[Sarawak]], [[Malaysia]]]]
Shellfish is a common part of indigenous cuisines throughout the globe.

Some popular dishes using shellfish:


* [[Ceviche]]
* [[Cioppino]]
* [[Callaloo]]
* [[Clam chowder]]
* [[Curanto]]
* [[Fruits de mer]]
* [[Paella]]
* [[Sashimi]]
* [[Shrimp cocktail]]
* [[Lobster]] [[bisque (food)|bisque]]
* [[She-crab soup]]
* [[Sliced fish soup]]
* [[Sushi]]

==Religious dietary restrictions==
The [[Judaism|Jewish]] laws of [[Kashrut]] forbid the eating of shellfish. The book of [[Leviticus]] prohibits the consumption of shellfish.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Leviticus|11:9-12|31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Islamic dietary laws|In Islam]], the Shafi'i, Maliki and Hanbali schools allow it, while the Hanafi school does not allow it in Sunni Islam. The Shi'ite school ([[Ja'fari jurisprudence|Ja'fari]]) does not allow it (except shrimps and prawns). [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventists]] eat no shellfish.

In the [[history of the United States]], the term '''Reconstruction Era''' has two senses: the first covers the complete history of the entire U.S. from 1865 to 1877 following the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]; the second sense focuses on the transformation of the [[Southern United States]] from 1863 to 1877, as directed by Washington, with the reconstruction of state and society.  

From 1863  to 1869,  Presidents [[Abraham Lincoln]] and [[Andrew Johnson]] (who became president on April 14, 1865) took a moderate position designed to bring the South back to normal as soon as possible, while the  [[Radical Republican]]s (as they called themselves) used Congress to block the moderate approach, impose harsh terms, and upgrade the rights of the Freedmen (former slaves). The views of Lincoln and Johnson prevailed until the election of 1866, which enabled the Radicals to take control of policy, remove former Confederates from power, and enfranchise the Freedmen. A Republican coalition came to power in nearly all the southern states and set out to transform the society by setting up a free labor economy, with support from the Army and the Freedman's Bureau. The Radicals, upset at President Johnson's opposition to Congressional Reconstruction, filed impeachment charges but the action failed by one vote in the Senate. President [[Ulysses S. Grant]] supported Radical Reconstruction, using both the [[United States Justice Department|U.S. Justice Department]] and the U.S. military to suppress white insurgency and support Republican reconstructed states. Southern Democrats, alleging widespread corruption, counterattacked and regained power in each state by 1877. President [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] blocked efforts to overturn Reconstruction legislation.

The deployment of the U.S. military was central to the establishment of Southern Reconstructed state governments and the suppression of violence against black and white voters.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Blair|Blair]] (2005), p. 393.&lt;/ref&gt; Reconstruction was a remarkable chapter in the story of American freedom, but most historians consider it a failure because the region became a poverty-stricken backwater and whites re-established their supremacy, making the Freedmen second-class citizens by the turn of the century.  Historian [[Eric Foner]] argues, &quot;What remains certain is that Reconstruction failed, and that for blacks its failure was a disaster whose magnitude cannot be obscured by the genuine accomplishments that did endure.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Eric Foner, ''Reconstruction: America's unfinished revolution, 1863-1877'' (1988) [http://books.google.com/books?id=cwVkgrvctCcC&amp;pg=PA604&amp;dq=%22What+remains+certain+is+that+Reconstruction+failed,&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=cDVbT4OODo2nsALDmNnEDQ&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22What%20remains%20certain%20is%20that%20Reconstruction%20failed%2C&amp;f=false p. 604 online]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dating the Reconstruction era==
In the different states Reconstruction began and ended at different times; federal Reconstruction finally ended with the [[Compromise of 1877]].&lt;ref&gt;In recent decades most historians follow Foner (1988) in dating the Reconstruction of the South as starting in 1863 (with emancipation) rather than 1865; the usual ending has always been 1877.&lt;/ref&gt; Reconstruction policies were debated in the North when the war began, and commenced in earnest after the [[Emancipation Proclamation]], issued on January 1, 1863.

==Overview==
Reconstruction policies were implemented when a Confederate state came under the control of the Union Army. President [[Abraham Lincoln]] set up reconstructed governments in several southern states during the war, including [[History of Tennessee|Tennessee]], [[History of Arkansas|Arkansas]], and [[History of Louisiana|Louisiana]]. He experimented with giving land to former slaves in [[History of South Carolina|South Carolina]]. Following Lincoln's assassination in April 1865, president [[Andrew Johnson]] tried to follow Lincoln's policies and appointed new governors in the summer of 1865. Johnson quickly declared that the war goals of national unity and the ending of slavery had been achieved, so that reconstruction was completed. Republicans in Congress refused to accept Johnson's terms, rejected the new members of Congress elected by the South, and in 1865/66 broke with the president. A sweeping Republican victory in the [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1866|1866 Congressional elections]] in the North gave the Radical Republicans enough control of Congress to override Johnson's vetoes and began what is called &quot;Radical Reconstruction&quot; in 1867.&lt;ref name=&quot;Foner 2009&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|title=If Lincoln hadn’t died...

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Congress removed the civilian governments in the South in 1867 and put the former Confederacy under the rule of the U.S. Army.&lt;ref&gt;Except in Tennessee, where anti-Johnson Republicans already were in control.&lt;/ref&gt; The army conducted new elections in which the freed slaves could vote, while whites who held leading positions under the Confederacy were temporarily denied the vote and could not run for office.

In ten states,&lt;ref&gt;Not including [[Virginia]]&lt;/ref&gt; coalitions of [[freedmen]], recent black and white arrivals from the North ([[carpetbagger]]s), and white Southerners who supported Reconstruction ([[scalawag]]s) cooperated to form [[History of the Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] biracial state governments.  They introduced various reconstruction programs, including the founding of public schools in most states for the first time, and the establishment of charitable institutions. They raised taxes, which historically had been low as planters preferred to make private investments for their own purposes; offered massive aid to support railroads to improve transportation and shipping. Conservative opponents charged that Republican regimes were marred by widespread corruption. Violent opposition towards freedmen and whites who supported Reconstruction emerged in numerous localities under the name of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] (KKK), a secret vigilante organization, which led to [[Force_Acts#Acts_after_the_Civil_War|federal intervention]] by President [[Ulysses S. Grant]] in 1871 that suppressed the Klan. White [[History of the Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] calling themselves &quot;[[Redeemers]]&quot; regained control state by state, sometimes using fraud and violence to control state elections. A deep national economic depression following the [[Panic of 1873]] led to major Democratic gains in the North, the collapse of many railroad schemes in the South, and a growing sense of frustration in the North.

The end of Reconstruction was a staggered process, and the period of Republican control ended at different times in different states. With the Compromise of 1877, Army intervention in the South ceased and Republican control collapsed in the last three state governments in the South. This was followed by a period that white Southerners labeled [[Redemption (United States history)|Redemption]], in which white-dominated state legislatures enacted [[Jim Crow laws]] and (after 1890) [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disfranchised]] most blacks and many poor whites through a combination of constitutional amendments and electoral laws. The white Democrat Southerners' memory of Reconstruction played a major role in imposing the system of [[white supremacy]] and [[second-class citizen]]ship for blacks, known as the age of [[Jim Crow]].&lt;ref&gt;Bruce E. Baker, ''What Reconstruction Meant: Historical Memory in the American South'' (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
Reconstruction addressed how the eleven seceding states would regain self-government and be reseated in Congress, the civil status of the former leaders of the Confederacy, and the [[United States Constitution|Constitutional]] and legal status of [[Freedman|freedmen]], especially their civil rights and whether they should be given the right to vote. Violent controversy erupted throughout the South over these issues.&lt;ref&gt;A somewhat similar &quot;reconstruction&quot; process took place in the border states of Missouri and Kentucky, but they had never left the Union and were never controlled by Congress.&lt;/ref&gt;

The laws and constitutional amendments that laid the foundation for the most radical phase of Reconstruction were adopted from 1866 to 1871. By the 1870s, Reconstruction had officially provided freedmen with equal rights under the constitution, and blacks were voting and taking political office.  Republican legislatures, coalitions of whites and blacks, established the first public school systems and numerous charitable institutions in the South.  Beginning in 1874, however, there was a rise in white [[paramilitary organization]]s, such as the [[White League]] and [[Red Shirts (Southern United States)|Red Shirts]] in the [[Deep South]], whose political aim was to drive out the Republicans. They also disrupted political organizing and terrorized blacks to bar them from the polls in Louisiana, Mississippi, North and South Carolina.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Lemann, ''Redemption: The Last Battle of the Civil War'', (2007), p. 75–77.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1873 to 1877, conservative white Democrats (calling themselves &quot;Redeemers&quot;) regained power in the states.

In the 1860s and 1870s the terms &quot;radical&quot; and &quot;conservative&quot; had distinctive meanings. &quot;Conservatism&quot; in this context generally indicates the mindset of the ruling elite of the planter class. Many leaders{{clarify|date=August 2012}} had been Whigs and were committed to modernization.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas B. Alexander, &quot;Persistent Whiggery in the Confederate South, 1860–1877&quot;, ''Journal of Southern History,'' Vol. 27, No. 3 (Aug., 1961), p. 305–329 [http://www.jstor.org/stable/2205211  in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the &quot;radical&quot; Republicans in the North were men who believed in free enterprise and industrialization; most were also modernizers and former Whigs.&lt;ref&gt;Allen W. Trelease, &quot;Republican Reconstruction in North Carolina: A Roll-Call Analysis of the State House of Representatives, 1866–1870&quot;, ''Journal of Southern History,'' Vol. XLII, No. 3 (August 1976).&lt;/ref&gt; The &quot;Liberal Republicans&quot; of 1872 shared the same outlook except they were especially opposed to the corruption they saw around President Grant, and believed that the goals had been achieved so that the federal intervention could now end.

Passage of the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|13th]], [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th]], and [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|15th Amendments]] are constitutional legacies of Reconstruction. These [[Reconstruction Amendments]] established the rights which, through extensive [[litigation]], led to [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] rulings starting in the early 20th century that struck down discriminatory state laws. A &quot;Second Reconstruction&quot;, sparked by the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955–1968)|Civil Rights Movement]], led to civil rights laws in 1964 and 1965 that protected and enforced full civic rights of African Americans.

==Material devastation of the South in 1865==

Reconstruction played out against a backdrop of a once prosperous economy in ruins. The Confederacy in 1861 had 297 towns and cities with a combined population of 835,000; of these, 162 locations with 681,000 total residents were at one point occupied by Union forces. Eleven were destroyed or severely damaged by war action, including [[Atlanta]], Georgia; [[Charleston, South Carolina]]; [[Columbia, South Carolina]]; and [[Richmond, Virginia]]; these eleven contained 115,900 people in the 1860 census, or 14% of the urban South. The number of people who lived in the destroyed towns represented just over 1% of the Confederacy's combined urban and rural populations. In addition, 45 [[courthouse]]s were burned (out of 830), destroying the documentation for the legal relationships in the affected communities.&lt;ref name = Paskoff&gt;Paskoff, &quot;Measures of War: A Quantitative Examination of the Civil War's Destructiveness in the Confederacy, ''Civil War History'' 54.1&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Farms were in disrepair, and the prewar stock of horses, mules and cattle was much depleted; two-fifths of the South's livestock had been killed.&lt;ref name=&quot;mcpherson2&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title=Abraham Lincoln and the Second American Revolution | publisher=Oxford University Press | author=McPherson, James M | year=1992 | pages=38 | isbn=978-0-19-507606-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The South's farms were not highly mechanized, but the value of farm implements and machinery in the 1860 Census was $81 million and was reduced by 40% by 1870.&lt;ref&gt;William B. Hesseltine, ''A History of the South, 1607–1936'' (1936), p. 573–574.&lt;/ref&gt; The transportation infrastructure lay in ruins, with little railroad or [[riverboat]] service available to move crops and animals to market.&lt;ref&gt;John Samuel Ezell, ''The South since 1865'' (1963) p. 27–28.&lt;/ref&gt; Railroad mileage was located mostly in rural areas and over two-thirds of the South's rails, bridges, rail yards, repair shops and rolling stock were in areas reached by Union armies, which systematically destroyed what they could. Even in untouched areas, the lack of maintenance and repair, the absence of new equipment, the heavy over-use, and the deliberate relocation of equipment by the Confederates from remote areas to the war zone ensured the system would be ruined at war's end.&lt;ref name = Paskoff/&gt; Restoring the infrastructure — especially the railroad system — became a high priority for Reconstruction state governments.

The enormous cost of the Confederate war effort took a high toll on the South's economic infrastructure.  The direct costs to the Confederacy in [[human capital]], government expenditures, and physical destruction from the war totaled $3.3 billion.  By 1865, the Confederate dollar was worthless due to massive inflation, and people in the South had to resort to bartering services for goods, or else use scarce Union dollars.  With the emancipation of the southern slaves, the entire economy of the South had to be rebuilt. Having lost their enormous investment in slaves, white planters had minimal capital to pay freedmen workers to bring in crops.  As a result, a system of [[sharecropping]] was developed where landowners broke up large plantations and rented small lots to the freedmen and their families.  The South was transformed from a prosperous minority of landed gentry slaveholders into a [[tenant farming]] agriculture system.

The end of the Civil War was accompanied by a large migration of new freedpeople to the cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Jacqueline|title=Labor of Love, Labor of Sorrow: Black Women, Work, and the Family, from Slavery to the Present|year=2010|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the cities, African Americans were relegated to the lowest paying jobs such as unskilled and service labor. Men worked as rail workers, rolling and lumber mills workers, and hotels workers. The large population of slave artisans during antebellum had not translated into a large number of freemen artisans during the Reconstruction.&lt;ref name='&quot;To Joy My Freedom'&gt;{{cite book|last=Hunter|first=Tera W.|title=To 'Joy My Freedom: Southern Black Women's Lives and Labors after the Civil War|year=1997|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge|pages=21–73}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Black women were largely confined to domestic work employed as cooks, maids, and child nurses. Others worked in hotels. A large number became laundresses.

Over a fourth of Southern white men of military age — meaning the backbone of the South's white workforce — died during the war, leaving countless families destitute.&lt;ref name=&quot;mcpherson2&quot;/&gt; Per capita income for white southerners declined from $125 in 1857 to a low of $80 in 1879.  By the end of the 19th century and well into the 20th century, the South was locked into a system of poverty. How much of this failure was caused by the war and by previous reliance on agriculture remains the subject of debate among economists and historians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ransom |first=Roger L. |title=The Economics of the Civil War |url=http://eh.net/encyclopedia/article/ransom.civil.war.us |date=February 1, 2010 |accessdate=2010-03-07}} Direct costs for the Confederacy are based on the value of the dollar in 1860.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Restoring the South to the Union==
[[File:Lincoln and Johnsond.jpg|right|thumb|300px|A political cartoon of Andrew Johnson and Abraham Lincoln, 1865, entitled &quot;The Rail Splitter At Work Repairing the Union.&quot; The caption reads (Johnson): ''Take it quietly Uncle Abe and I will draw it closer than ever.'' (Lincoln): ''A few more stitches Andy and the good old Union will be mended.'']]
During the Civil War, the Radical Republican leaders argued that slavery and the [[Slave Power]] had to be permanently destroyed, and that all forms of Confederate nationalism had to be suppressed. Moderates said this could be easily accomplished as soon as [[Confederate States Army|Confederate armies]] surrendered and the Southern states repealed secession and accepted the 13th Amendment – most of which happened by December 1865.&lt;ref&gt;Donald, ''Civil War and Reconstruction'' (2001), ch. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

President Lincoln was the leader of the moderate Republicans and wanted to speed up Reconstruction and reunite the nation painlessly and quickly. Lincoln formally began Reconstruction in late 1863 with his [[Ten percent plan]], which went into operation in several states but which Radical Republicans opposed. Lincoln vetoed the Radical plan, the [[Wade–Davis Bill]] of 1864, which was much more strict than the Ten-Percent Plan.&lt;ref name=&quot;Foner 2009&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Simpson (2009); William C. Harris, ''With Charity for All: Lincoln and the Restoration of the Union'' (1999).&lt;/ref&gt;

The opposing faction of Radical Republicans were skeptical of Southern intentions and demanded more stringent federal action. Congressman [[Thaddeus Stevens]] of [[Pennsylvania]] and Senator [[Charles Sumner]] of [[Massachusetts]] led the Radicals. Sumner argued that secession had destroyed statehood but the Constitution still extended its authority and its protection over individuals, as in [[Organized incorporated territories of the United States|existing U.S. territories]]. Thaddeus Stevens and his followers viewed secession as having left the states in a status like new territories. The Republicans sought to prevent Southern politicians from &quot;restoring the historic subordination of Negroes&quot;. Since slavery was abolished, the [[three-fifths compromise]] no longer applied to counting the population of blacks. After the 1870 census, the South would gain numerous additional representatives in Congress, based on the population of freedmen.&lt;ref&gt;All blacks would be counted in 1870, whether or not they were citizens.&lt;/ref&gt; One Illinois Republican expressed a common fear that if the South were allowed to simply restore its previous established powers, that the &quot;reward of treason will be an increased representation&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Upon [[Abraham Lincoln assassination|Lincoln's assassination]] in April 1865, Andrew Johnson of Tennessee, who had been elected with Lincoln in 1864 as the latter's vice president, became president. Johnson rejected the Radical program of harsh, lengthy Reconstruction and instead appointed his own governors and tried to finish reconstruction by the end of 1865. Thaddeus Stevens vehemently opposed President Johnson's plans for an abrupt end to Reconstruction, insisting that Reconstruction must &quot;revolutionize Southern institutions, habits, and manners… The foundations of their institutions… must be broken up and relaid, or all our blood and treasure have been spent in vain.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;mcpherson3&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title=Abraham Lincoln and the Second American Revolution | publisher=Oxford University Press | author=McPherson, James M | year=1992 | pages=6 | isbn=978-0-19-507606-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By early 1866, full-scale political warfare existed between Johnson (now allied with the Democrats) and the Radical Republicans; he vetoed laws and issued orders that contradicted Congressional legislation.&lt;ref&gt;Donald, ''Civil War and Reconstruction'' (2001); Hans L. Trefousse, ''Andrew Johnson: A Biography'' (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

Congress rejected Johnson's argument that he had the war power to decide what to do, since the war was over. Congress decided it had the primary authority to decide how Reconstruction should proceed, because the Constitution stated the United States had to guarantee each state a [[Republicanism in the United States|republican form of government]]. The Radicals insisted that meant Congress decided how Reconstruction should be achieved. The issues were multiple: who should decide, Congress or the president? How should republicanism operate in the South? What was the status of the Confederate states? What was the citizenship status of men who had supported the Confederacy? What was the citizenship and suffrage status of freedmen?&lt;ref&gt;Donald, ''Civil War and Reconstruction'' (2001), ch. 26–27.&lt;/ref&gt;

The election of 1866 decisively changed the balance of power, giving the Republicans two-thirds majorities in both houses of Congress, and enough votes to overcome Johnson's vetoes. They moved to [[Impeachment of Andrew Johnson|impeach Johnson]] because of his constant attempts to thwart Radical Reconstruction measures, by using the [[Tenure of Office Act (1867)|Tenure of Office Act]]. Johnson was acquitted by one vote, but he lost the influence to shape Reconstruction policy.&lt;ref&gt;Donald, ''Civil War and Reconstruction'' (2001), ch. 28–29&lt;/ref&gt;

The Republican Congress established military districts in the South and used [[United States Army|Army]] personnel to administer the region until new governments loyal to the Union could be established. Congress temporarily suspended the ability to vote of approximately 10,000 to 15,000 white men who had been Confederate officials or senior officers, while constitutional amendments gave full citizenship and suffrage to former slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Donald, ''Civil War and Reconstruction'' (2001) ch 29&lt;/ref&gt;

With the power to vote, freedmen started participating in politics. While many slaves were illiterate, educated blacks (including escaped slaves) moved down from the North to aid them, and natural leaders also stepped forward. They elected white and black men to represent them in constitutional conventions. A Republican coalition of freedmen, southerners supportive of the Union (derisively called scalawags by white Democrats), and northerners who had migrated to the South (derisively called carpetbaggers) — some of whom were returning natives, but were mostly Union veterans -, organized to create constitutional conventions. They created new state constitutions to set new directions for southern states.&lt;ref&gt;Donald, ''Civil War and Reconstruction'' (2001), ch 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Loyalty===
The issue of loyalty emerged in the debates over the [[Wade–Davis Bill]] of 1864. The bill required voters to take the &quot;[[ironclad oath]]&quot;, swearing they had never supported the Confederacy or been one of its soldiers. Pursuing a policy of &quot;malice toward none&quot; announced in his second inaugural address,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theatlantic.com/issues/99sep/9909lincaddress.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln asked voters only to support the Union.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, ''With Charity for All'' (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; The Radicals lost support following Lincoln's veto of the Wade–Davis Bill but regained strength after Lincoln's assassination in April 1865.

===Suffrage===
[[File:Grand Army of the Republic by Swatjester.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Monument in honor of the Grand Army of the Republic, organized after the war]]
Congress had to consider how to restore to full status and representation within the Union those southern states that had declared their independence from the United States and had withdrawn their representation. [[Suffrage]] for former Confederates was one of two main concerns. A decision needed to be made whether to allow just some or all former Confederates to vote (and to hold office). The moderates wanted virtually all of them to vote, but the Radicals resisted. They repeatedly tried to impose the ironclad oath, which would effectively have allowed no former Confederates to vote. Radical Republican leader Thaddeus Stevens proposed, unsuccessfully, that all former Confederates lose the right to vote for five years. The compromise that was reached disfranchised many former Confederate civil and military leaders. No one knows how many temporarily lost the vote, but one estimate was 10,000 to 15,000.&lt;ref&gt;Foner 1988, p. 273–276.&lt;/ref&gt;

Second, and closely related, was the issue of whether freedmen should be allowed to vote. The issue was how to receive the four million former slaves as citizens. If they were to be fully counted as citizens, some sort of representation for apportionment of seats in Congress had to be determined. Before the war, the population of slaves had been counted as three-fifths of a comparable number of free whites. By having four million freedmen counted as full citizens, the South would gain additional seats in Congress. If blacks were denied the vote and the right to hold office, then only whites would represent them. Many conservatives, including most white southerners, northern Democrats, and some northern Republicans, opposed black voting. Some northern states that had referenda on the subject limited the ability of their own small populations of blacks to vote.

Lincoln had supported a middle position to allow some black men to vote, especially army veterans. Johnson also believed that such service should be rewarded with citizenship. Lincoln proposed giving the vote to &quot;the very intelligent, and especially those who have fought gallantly in our ranks.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;William Gienapp, ''Abraham Lincoln and Civil War America'' (2002), p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1864, Governor Johnson said, &quot;The better class of them will go to work and sustain themselves, and that class ought to be allowed to vote, on the ground that a loyal negro is more worthy than a disloyal white man.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Patton, p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt; As President in 1865, Johnson wrote to the man he appointed as governor of [[Mississippi]], recommending, &quot;If you could extend the elective franchise to all persons of color who can read the Constitution in English and write their names, and to all persons of color who own real estate valued at at least two hundred and fifty dollars, and pay taxes thereon, you would completely disarm the adversary [Radicals in Congress], and set an example the other states will follow.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Johnson to Gov. William L. Sharkey, August 1865 quoted in Franklin (1961), p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:FreedmenVotingInNewOrleans1867.jpeg|thumb|250px|Freedmen voting in New Orleans, 1867]]
Charles Sumner and Thaddeus Stevens, leaders of the Radical Republicans, were initially hesitant to enfranchise the largely illiterate former slave population. Sumner preferred at first impartial requirements that would have imposed literacy restrictions on blacks and whites. He believed that he would not succeed in passing legislation to disfranchise illiterate whites who already had the vote.&lt;ref&gt;Donald, ''Charles Sumner'', p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the South, many poor whites were illiterate as there was almost no public education before the war. In 1880, for example, the white illiteracy rate was about 25% in Tennessee, Kentucky, [[Alabama]], South Carolina, and Georgia; and as high as 33% in North Carolina. This compares with the 9% national rate, and a black rate of illiteracy that was over 70% in the South.&lt;ref&gt;Ayers, p. 418.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1900, however, with emphasis within the black community on education, the majority of blacks had achieved literacy.&lt;ref&gt;James D. Anderson, ''The Education of Blacks in the South, 1860–1935'', p. 244–245.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sumner soon concluded that &quot;there was no substantial protection for the freedman except in the franchise.&quot; This was necessary, he stated, &quot;(1) For his own protection; (2) For the protection of the white Unionist; and (3) For the peace of the country. We put the musket in his hands because it was necessary; for the same reason we must give him the franchise.&quot; The support for voting rights was a compromise between moderate and Radical Republicans.&lt;ref&gt;Randall and Donald, p. 581&lt;/ref&gt;

The Republicans believed that the best way for men to get political experience was to be able to vote and to participate in the political system. They passed laws allowing all male freedmen to vote. In 1867, black men voted for the first time. Over the course of Reconstruction, more than 1,500 African Americans held public office in the South; some of them were men who had escaped to the North and gained educations, and returned to the South. They did not hold office in numbers representative of their proportion in the population, but often elected whites to represent them.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Foner, ''Freedom's lawmakers: a directory of Black officeholders during Reconstruction'' (1993).&lt;/ref&gt;  The question of [[women's suffrage]] was also debated but was rejected.&lt;ref&gt;Ellen DuBois, ''Feminism and suffrage: The emergence of an independent women's movement in America'' (1978)&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1890 to 1908, southern states passed new constitutions and laws that disfranchised most blacks and tens of thousands of poor whites with new voter registration and electoral rules. When establishing new requirements such as subjectively administered [[literacy tests]], in some states, they used &quot;[[grandfather clauses]]&quot; to enable illiterate whites to vote.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn Feldman, ''The Disfranchisement Myth: Poor Whites and Suffrage Restriction in Alabama'', (2004), p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Southern Treaty Commission===
The [[Five Civilized Tribes]] that had been relocated to [[Indian Territory]] (now part of [[Oklahoma]]) held black slaves and signed treaties supporting  the Confederacy. During the war a civil war among pro- and anti-Union Indians raged. Congress passed a statute that gave the President the authority to suspend the appropriations of any tribe if the tribe is “in a state of actual hostility to the government of the United States… and, by proclamation, to declare all treaties with such tribe to be abrogated by such tribe”(25 USC Sec. 72).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://uscode.house.gov/download/pls/25C3.txt | title=Act of Congress, R.S.

As a component of Reconstruction, the Interior Department ordered a meeting of representatives from all Indian tribes which had affiliated with the Confederacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://digital.library.okstate.edu/Chronicles/v014/v014p022.html | title=Perry, Dan W. &quot;Oklahoma, A Foreordained Commonwealth&quot; Chronicles of Oklahoma, Volume 14, No. 1, March 1936, p30 (Oklahoma Historical Society) | accessdate=2012-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Council, the [[Reconstruction Treaties|Southern Treaty Commission]], was first held in [[Ft. Smith, Arkansas]] in September 1865, was attended by hundreds of Indians representing dozens of tribes. Over the next several years the commission negotiated treaties with tribes that resulted in additional relocations to [[Indian Territory]] and the de facto creation (initially by treaty) of an unorganized [[Oklahoma Territory]].

==Lincoln's Presidential Reconstruction==
[[File:AbrahamLincolnOilPainting1869Restored.jpg|thumb|right|175px|President Abraham Lincoln&lt;p&gt; 16th President of the United States&lt;p&gt;'''''1861–1865''''']]

===Preliminary events===
President Lincoln signed two [[Confiscation Acts]] into law, the first on August 6, 1861, and the second on July 17, 1862, safeguarding fugitive slaves from the Confederacy that came over into Union lines and giving them indirect emancipation if their masters continued insurrection against the United States.  The laws allowed the confiscation of lands for colonization from those who aided and supported the rebellion. However, these laws had limited effect as they were poorly funded by Congress and poorly enforced by Attorney General [[Edward Bates]].&lt;ref&gt;Cimbala, Miller, and Syrette (2002), ''An uncommon time: the Civil War and the northern home front'', pp. 285, 305&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wagner, Gallagher, and McPherson, ''The Library of Congress Civil War Desk Reference'', p. 735-736.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Williams 2006 pp. 54–59&quot;&gt;Williams (2006), ''&quot;Doing Less&quot; and &quot;Doing More&quot;'', p. 54–59&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1861, Maj. Gen. [[John C. Frémont]], Union commander of the Western Department, declared martial law in [[Missouri]], confiscated Confederate property, and emancipated their slaves. President Lincoln immediately ordered Frémont to rescind his emancipation declaration stating, &quot;I think there is great danger that&amp;nbsp;... the liberating slaves of traitorous owners, will alarm our Southern Union friends, and turn them against us – perhaps ruin our fair prospect for Kentucky.&quot;  After Frémont refused to rescind the emancipation order, President Lincoln terminated him from active duty on November 2, 1861.  Lincoln was concerned that border states would bolt from the Union if slaves were given their freedom.  On May 26, 1862, Union Maj. Gen. [[David Hunter]] emancipated slaves in South Carolina, [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], and Florida stated all &quot;persons&amp;nbsp;... heretofore held as slaves&amp;nbsp;... forever free.&quot;  Lincoln, embarrassed by the order, rescinded Hunter's declaration and canceled the emancipations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

On April 16, 1862 Lincoln signed a bill into law outlawing slavery in Washington D.C. and freeing the estimated 3,500 slaves in the city and on June 19, 1862 he signed legislation outlawing slavery in all U.S. territories. In July 1862, under the authority of the Confiscation Acts and an amended Force Bill of 1795, he authorized the recruitment of freed slaves into the Union army and seizure of any Confederate property for military purposes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Williams 2006 pp. 54–59&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Trefousse (1991), ''Historical dictionary of reconstruction'', p. viiii&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Abraham Lincoln

===Gradual emancipation and compensation===
In an effort to keep border states in the Union, President Lincoln as early as 1861 designed gradual compensated emancipation programs paid for by government bonds. Lincoln desired  [[Delaware]], [[Maryland]], [[Kentucky]], and Missouri to &quot;adopt a system of gradual emancipation which should work the extinction of slavery in twenty years.&quot;  On March 26, 1862 Lincoln met with Senator Charles Sumner and recommended that a special joint session of Congress be conveyed to discuss giving financial aid to any border states who initiated a gradual emancipation plan.  In April 1862, the joint session of Congress met, however, the border states were not interested and did not make any response to Lincoln or any Congressional emancipation proposal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guelzo 1999&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Guelzo |first=Allen C. |title=Abraham Lincoln: Redeemer President |pages=333–335 |year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln advocated compensated emancipation during the 1865 River Queen steamer conference.

===Colonization===
In August 1862, President Lincoln met with African American leaders and urged them to colonize some place in Central America.  Lincoln planned to free the Southern slaves in the Emancipation Proclamation and he was concerned that freedmen would not be well treated in the United States by Whites both in the North and South.  Although Lincoln gave assurances that the United States government would support and protect any colonies, the leaders declined the offer of colonization.  Many free blacks had been opposed to colonization plans in the past and wanted to remain in the United States.  President Lincoln persisted in his colonization plan believing that emancipation and colonization were part of the same program.  Lincoln was successful by April 1863 at sending black colonists to [[Haiti]] and 453 to [[Chiriquí Province|Chiriqui]] in Central America; however, none of the colonies was able to remain self-sufficient. [[Frederick Douglass]], a prominent 19th-century American civil rights activist, criticized that Lincoln was &quot;showing all his inconsistencies, his pride of race and blood, his contempt for Negroes and his canting hypocrisy.&quot;  African Americans, according to Douglas, wanted citizen rights rather than to be colonized.  Historians debate if Lincoln gave up on African American colonization at the end of 1863 or if he actually planned to continue this policy up until 1865.&lt;ref name=&quot;Williams 2006 pp. 54–59&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Guelzo 1999&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Catton 1963 pp. 365–367&quot;&gt;Catton (1963), ''Terrible Swift Sword'', pp. 365–367, 461–468&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military governors installed===
Starting in March 1862, in an effort to forestall Reconstruction by the Radicals in Congress, President Lincoln installed military governors in certain rebellious states under Union military control.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

|page=390
|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the states would not be recognized by the Radicals until an undetermined time, installation of military governors kept the administration of Reconstruction under Presidential control, rather than that of the increasingly unsympathetic Radical Congress. On March 3, 1862, Lincoln installed a loyalist Democrat Senator Andrew Johnson, as Military Governor with the rank of Brigadier General in his home state of Tennessee.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title=Andrew Johnson: military governor of Tennessee

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1862, Lincoln appointed [[Edward Stanly]] Military Governor of the coastal region of [[North Carolina]] with the rank of Brigadier General.  Stanly resigned almost a year later when he angered Lincoln by closing two schools for black children in [[New Bern, North Carolina|New Bern]]. After Lincoln installed Brigadier General [[George Foster Shepley (Maine and Louisiana)|George F. Sheply]] as Military Governor of Louisiana in May 1862, Sheply sent two  anti-slavery representatives, [[Benjamin Flanders]] and [[Michael Hahn]], elected in December 1862, to the House which capitulated and voted to seat them. In July 1862, Lincoln installed Colonel [[John S. Phelps]] as Military Governor of Arkansas, though he resigned soon after due to poor health.

===Emancipation Proclamation===
{{Main|Emancipation Proclamation}}
[[File:EmancipationPhoto.jpg|thumb|Celebration of the Emancipation Proclamation in Massachusetts, 1862]]
In July 1862, President Lincoln became convinced that &quot;a military necessity&quot; was needed to strike at slavery in order to win the Civil War for the Union.  The Confiscation Acts were only having a minimal effect to end slavery. On July 22, he wrote a first draft of the Emancipation Proclamation that freed the slaves in states in rebellion.  Lincoln decided not to release the document until there was a Union victory in the battlefield.  After he showed his cabinet the document, slight alterations were made in the wording. Then on September 22, 1862, [[George B. McClellan|George McClellan]] defeated [[Robert E. Lee]] at [[Antietam]]; the second draft of the Emancipation Proclamation was issued to the public the following day.
On January 1, 1863, the second part of the Emancipation Proclamation was issued, specifically naming ten states in which slaves would be &quot;forever free&quot;.  The proclamation did not name the states of Tennessee, Kentucky, Missouri, Maryland, and Delaware, and specifically excluded numerous counties in some other states.  Eventually, as the Union Armies advanced into the Confederacy millions of slaves were set free. Many of these freedmen joined the Union army and fought in battles against the Confederate forces.&lt;ref name=&quot;Williams 2006 pp. 54–59&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Catton 1963 pp. 365–367&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Guelzo (2004), ''Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation: The End of Slavery in America'', p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Yet hundreds of thousands of freed slaves died during emancipation as a result of the illness that devastated army regiments. Freed slaves suffered from smallpox, yellow fever, and malnutrition.&lt;ref&gt;Sick from Freedom, First Edition, New York, Oxford University Press, 2012,&lt;/ref&gt;

===Louisiana 10% electorate plan===
President Abraham Lincoln was concerned to effect a speedy restoration of the Confederate states to the Union after the Civil War.  In 1863, President Lincoln proposed a moderate plan for the Reconstruction of the captured Confederate State of Louisiana.  The plan granted amnesty to Rebels who took an oath of loyalty to the Union.  Black Freedmen workers were tied to labor on plantations for one year at $10 a month pay.&lt;ref&gt;Stauffer (2008), ''Giants'', p. 279&lt;/ref&gt; Only 10% of the state's electorate had to take the loyalty oath in order for the state to be readmitted into U.S. Congress.  The state was required to abolish slavery in its new constitution.  Identical Reconstruction plans would be adopted in Arkansas and Tennessee.  By December 1864, the Lincoln plan of Reconstruction had been enacted in Louisiana and the legislature sent two Senators and five Representatives to take their seats in Washington.  However, Congress refused to count any of the votes from Louisiana, Arkansas, and Tennessee, in essence rejecting Lincoln's moderate Reconstruction plan.  Congress, at this time controlled by the Radicals, proposed the Wade–Davis Bill that required a majority of the state electorates to take the oath of loyalty to be admitted to Congress. Lincoln [[Pocket veto|pocket-vetoed]] the bill and the rift widened between the moderates, who wanted to save the Union and win the war, and the Radicals, who wanted to effect a more complete change within Southern society.&lt;ref name=&quot;Peterson 1995 pp. 38–41&quot;&gt;Peterson (1995) ''Lincoln in American Memory'', pp. 38–41&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;McCarthy 1901 p. 76&quot;&gt;McCarthy (1901), ''Lincoln's plan of Reconstruction'', p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;  Frederick Douglass denounced Lincoln's 10% electorate plan undemocratic since state admission and loyalty only depended on a minority vote.&lt;ref&gt;Stauffer (2008), ''Giants'', p. 280&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legalization of slave unions===
Prior to 1864, slave marriages were not legally recognized; emancipation did not affect them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Labor of Love, Labor of Sorrow&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; When freed, many former slaves made official marriages. Before emancipation, slaves could not enter into contracts, including the marriage contract. After emancipation, former slaves and whites both began to view the lack of officially recognized marriage for their unions as problematic.  Not all free people formalized their unions.  Some continued to have common-law marriages or community-recognized relationships.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Making of the American South&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Harris|first=J. William|title=The Making of the American South: a Short History 1500–1977|year=2006|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|location=Malden|page=240}}&lt;/ref&gt; The acknowledgement of marriage by the state increased the state’s recognition of freedpeople as legal actors and eventually helped make the case for parental rights for freedpeople against the practice of apprenticeship of black children.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gendered Strife and Confusion&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Edwards|first=Laura F.|title=Gendered Strife and Confusion: The Political Culture of Reconstruction|year=1997|publisher=University of Illinois Press|location=Chicago|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These children were legally taken away from their families under the guise of “providing the with guardianship and ‘good’ homes until they reached the age of consent at twenty-one” under acts such as the Georgia 1866 Apprentice Act.&lt;ref name=&quot;To 'Joy My Freedom&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Hunter|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such children were generally used as sources of unpaid labor.

===Freedmen's Bureau===
{{Main|Freedmen's Bureau}}
[[File:Freedmen richmond sewing women.jpg|thumb|Northern teachers traveled into the South to provide education and training for the newly freed population.]]
On March 3, 1865 the [[Freedmen's Bureau Bill]] became law, sponsored by the Republicans to aid freedmen and white refugees.  A federal Bureau was created to provide food, clothing, fuel, and advice on negotiating labor contracts. It attempted to oversee new relations between freedmen and their former masters in a free labor market. The Act, without deference to a person's color, authorized the Bureau to lease confiscated land for a period of three years and to sell it in portions of up to 40 acres per buyer. The Bureau was to expire one year after the termination of the War. Lincoln was assassinated before he could appoint a commissioner of the Bureau. A popular myth was that the Act offered [[40 acres and a mule]], or that slaves had been promised this.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.snopes.com/business/taxes/blacktax.asp&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Freedmen's Bureau|url=http://tennesseeencyclopedia.net/imagegallery.php?EntryID=F069|year=1998|accessdate=2010-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Belz (1998)  ''Abraham Lincoln, constitutionalism, and equal rights in the Civil War era'', pp. 138,141,145&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bans color discrimination===
Other legislation was signed that broadened equality and rights for African Americans.  Lincoln outlawed discrimination on account of color, in carrying U.S. mail, in riding on public street cars in Washington D.C., and in pay for soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;Rawley (2003), ''Abraham Lincoln and a nation worth fighting for''. p. 205&lt;/ref&gt;

===February 1865 peace conference===
Lincoln and Secretary of State [[William H. Seward]] met with three southern representatives to discuss the peaceful reconstruction of the Union and the Confederacy on February 3, 1865 in [[Hampton Roads, Virginia|Hampton Roads]], Virginia.  The southern delegation included Confederate vice-president, [[Alexander H. Stephens]], [[John Archibald Campbell|John A. Campbell]], and [[Robert M.T. Hunter]].  The southerners proposed the Union recognition of the Confederacy, a joint Union-Confederate attack on Mexico to oust dictator [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Maximillian]], and an alternative subordinate status of servitude for blacks rather than slavery.  Lincoln flatly denied recognition of the Confederacy, and said that the slaves covered by his Emancipation Proclamation would not be re-enslaved.  He said that the Union States were about to pass the Thirteenth Amendment outlawing slavery. Lincoln urged the governor of Georgia to remove Confederate troops and &quot;ratify this Constitutional Amendment ''prospectively'', so as to take effect—say in five years&amp;nbsp;... Slavery is doomed.&quot;  Lincoln also urged compensated emancipation for the slaves as he thought the North should be willing to share the costs of freedom.  Although the meeting was cordial, the parties did not settle on agreements.&lt;ref&gt;McFeely (2002), ''Grant: A Biography'', pp. 198–207&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical legacy debated===
Lincoln continued to advocate his Louisiana Plan as a model for all states up until his assassination on April 14, 1865.  The plan successfully started the Reconstruction process of ratifying the Thirteenth Amendment in all states.  Lincoln is typically portrayed as taking the moderate position and fighting the Radical positions.  There is considerable debate on how well Lincoln, had he lived, would have handled Congress during the Reconstruction process that took place after the Civil War ended.  One historical camp argues that Lincoln's flexibility, pragmatism, and superior political skills with Congress would have solved Reconstruction with far less difficulty.  The other camp believes the Radicals would have attempted to impeach Lincoln, just as they did to his successor, Andrew Johnson, in 1868.&lt;ref name=&quot;Peterson 1995 pp. 38–41&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William C. Harris, ''With Charity for All: Lincoln and the Restoration of the Union'' (1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Johnson's presidential Reconstruction==
[[File:Aj17.gif|thumb|right|175px|President Andrew Johnson, 17th President of the United States]]
Northern anger over the assassination of Lincoln and the immense human cost of the war led to vengeful demands for harsh policies. Vice President Andrew Johnson had taken a hard line and spoke of hanging rebel Confederates, but when he succeeded Lincoln as President, Johnson took a much softer line, pardoning many Confederate leaders and former Confederates.&lt;ref&gt;Trefousse c1989&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jefferson Davis]] was held in prison for two years, but other Confederate leaders were not. There were no treason trials. Only one person—Captain [[Henry Wirz]], the commandant of the [[Andersonville prison|prison camp]] in [[Andersonville, Georgia]]—was executed for war crimes.  According to historian Eric Foner, Andrew Johnson's conservative view of Reconstruction did not include blacks or former slaves involvement in government and he refused to heed Northern concerns when southern state legislatures implemented [[Black Codes (United States)|Black Codes]] that lowered the status of the freedmen similar to slavery.&lt;ref name=&quot;Foner 2009&quot;/&gt;

President Andrew Johnson's Reconstruction policy would be known primarily for the nonenforcement and defiance of Reconstruction laws passed by the U.S. Congress and would be in constant conflict constitutionally with the Radicals in Congress over the status of freedmen and whites in the defeated South.&lt;ref name=&quot;McFeely-Woodward&quot;&gt;[[#McFeely-Woodward|McFeely-Woodward]] (1974), p. 125&lt;/ref&gt;  Although resigned to the abolition of slavery, many former Confederates were not willing to accept the social changes nor political domination by former slaves. The defeated were unwilling to acknowledge that their society had changed. In the words of [[Benjamin Franklin Perry|Benjamin F. Perry]], President Johnson's choice as the provisional governor of South Carolina: &quot;First, the Negro is to be invested with all political power, and then the antagonism of interest between capital and labor is to work out the result.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Barney, William L., ''The Passage of the Republic: An Interdisciplinary History of Nineteenth-Century America'' (1987), p. 245&lt;/ref&gt;

The fears, however, of the mostly conservative planter elite and other leading white citizens were partly assuaged by the actions of President Johnson, who ensured that a wholesale land redistribution from the planters to the freedman did not occur. President Johnson ordered that confiscated or abandoned lands administered by the Freedman's Bureau would not be redistributed to the freedmen but be returned to pardoned owners. Land was returned that would have been forfeited under the Confiscation Acts passed by Congress in 1861 and 1862.

===Freedmen and the enactment of Black Codes===
[[File:The Union as It Was.jpg|200px|thumb|left|An October 24th, 1874 [[Harper's Magazine]] editorial cartoon by [[Thomas Nast]] denouncing KKK and White League murders of innocent blacks]]
Southern state governments quickly enacted the restrictive &quot;[[Black Codes (United States)|black codes]]&quot;. However, they were abolished in 1866 and seldom had effect, because the Freedman's Bureau (not the local courts) handled the legal affairs of freedmen.

The Black Codes indicated the plans of the southern whites for the former slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Donald, ''Civil War and Reconstruction'' (2001) ch 31&lt;/ref&gt; The freedmen would have more rights than did free blacks before the war, but they still had only a limited set of second-class civil rights, no voting rights and no citizenship. They could not own firearms, serve on a jury in a lawsuit involving whites or move about without employment.&lt;ref&gt;Oberholtzer 1:128–9&lt;/ref&gt;  The Black Codes outraged northern opinion. They were overthrown by the [[Civil Rights Act of 1866]] that gave the freedmen full legal equality (except for the right to vote).&lt;ref&gt;Donald (2001) p. 527&lt;/ref&gt;

The freedmen rejected [[Gang system|gang labor]] work patterns that had been used in slavery; with the strong backing of the Freedman's Bureau.  Instead of gang labor, freedpeople preferred family-based labor groups.&lt;ref name=&quot;Labor of Love, Labor of Sorrow&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Hunter|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They forced planters to bargain for their labor. Such bargaining soon led to the establishment of the system of sharecropping, which gave the freedmen greater economic independence and social autonomy than gang labor. However, because they lacked capital and the planters continued to own the means of production (tools, draft animals and land), the freedmen were forced into producing cash crops (mainly cotton) for the land-owners and merchants, and they entered into a [[crop-lien system]].  Widespread poverty, disruption to an agricultural economy too dependent on cotton, and the falling price of cotton, led within decades to the routine indebtedness of the majority of the freedmen, and poverty by many planters.&lt;ref&gt;Barney, ''The Passage of the Republic'', p. 251, pp. 284–286&lt;/ref&gt;

Northern officials gave varying reports on conditions for the freedmen in the South. One harsh assessment came from [[Carl Schurz]], who reported on the situation in the states along the Gulf Coast. His report documented dozens of [[extra-judicial killing]]s and claimed that hundreds or thousands more African Americans were killed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://infomotions.com/etexts/gutenberg/dirs/etext05/cnsth10.htm Report on the Condition of the South / Schurz, Carl, 1829–1906]:&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The number of murders and assaults perpetrated upon Negroes is very great; we can form only an approximative estimate of what is going on in those parts of the South which are not closely garrisoned, and from which no regular reports are received, by what occurs under the very eyes of our military authorities. As to my personal experience, I will only mention that during my two days sojourn at Atlanta, one Negro was stabbed with fatal effect on the street, and three were poisoned, one of whom died. While I was at Montgomery, one negro was cut across the throat evidently with intent to kill, and another was shot, but both escaped with their lives. Several papers attached to this report give an account of the number of capital cases that occurred at certain places during a certain period of time. It is a sad fact that the perpetration of those acts is not confined to that class of people which might be called the rabble.
&lt;small&gt;Carl Schurz, &quot;Report on the Condition of the South&quot;, December 1865 (U.S. Senate Exec. Doc. No. 2, 39th Congress, 1st session).&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The report included sworn testimony from soldiers and officials of the Freedman's Bureau. In [[Selma, Alabama]], Major J.P. Houston noted that whites who killed 12 African Americans in his district never came to trial. Many more killings never became official cases. Captain Poillon described white patrols in southwestern Alabama

&lt;blockquote&gt;who board some of the boats; after the boats leave they hang, shoot, or drown the victims they may find on them, and all those found on the roads or coming down the rivers are almost invariably murdered. The bewildered and terrified freedmen know not what to do—to leave is death; to remain is to suffer the increased burden imposed upon them by the cruel taskmaster, whose only interest is their labor, wrung from them by every device an inhuman ingenuity can devise; hence the lash and murder is resorted to intimidate those whom fear of an awful death alone cause to remain, while patrols, Negro dogs and spies, disguised as Yankees, keep constant guard over these unfortunate people.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Much of the violence that was perpetrated against African Americans was shaped by gendered prejudices regarding African Americans.  Black women were in a particularly vulnerable situation.  To convict a white man of sexually assaulting black women in this period was exceedingly difficult.&lt;ref name=&quot;To 'Joy My Freedom&quot;/&gt;  Black women were socially constructed as sexually avaricious and since they were portrayed as having little virtue, society held that they could not be raped.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gendered Strife and Confusion&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Edwards|page=202}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This contributed to numerous sexual crimes against black women in this period.  For example, two freedwomen, Frances Thompson and Lucy Smith, describe their violent sexual assault during the [[Memphis Riots of 1866]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Freedwomen and the Freedmen's Bureau&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Farmer-Kaiser|first=Mary|title=Freedwomen and the Freedmen's Bureau: Race, Gender, and Public Policy in the Age of Emancipation|year=2010|publisher=Fordham University Press|location=New York|page=160}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, black women were vulnerable even in times of relative normalcy.  Sexual assaults on African American women were so pervasive, particularly on the part of their white employers, that black men sought to reduce the contact between white males and black females by having the women in their family avoid doing work that was closely overseen by whites.&lt;ref name=&quot;Labor of Love, Labor of Sorrow&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Black men were construed as being extremely sexually aggressive and their supposed or rumored threats to white women were often used as a pretext for [[lynching]] and castrations.&lt;ref name=&quot;To 'Joy My Freedom&quot;/&gt;

===Moderate responses===
During fall 1865, out of response to the Black codes and worrisome signs of Southern recalcitrance, the Radical Republicans blocked the readmission of the former rebellious states to the Congress.  Johnson, however, was content with allowing former Confederate states into the Union as long as their state governments adopted the 13th Amendment abolishing slavery.  By December 6, 1865, the amendment was ratified and Johnson considered Reconstruction over. Johnson was following the moderate Lincoln Presidential Reconstruction policy to get the states readmitted as soon as possible.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schouler 1913 43–57&quot;/&gt;

Congress, however, controlled by the Radicals, had other plans.  The Radicals were led by Charles Sumner in the Senate and Thaddeus Stevens in the House of Representatives.  Congress, on December 4, 1865, rejected Johnson's moderate Presidential Reconstruction, and organized the [[Joint Committee on Reconstruction]], a 15-member panel to devise reconstruction requirements for the Southern states to be restored to the Union.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schouler 1913 43–57&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Schouler|first=James|title=History of the United States of America under the Constitution, Volume 7 The Reconstruction Period|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=w3scAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA52&amp;dq=Freedman's+bureau+bill&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=Freedman's%20bureau%20bill&amp;f=false|pages=43–57|year=1913|accessdate=2010-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1866, Congress renewed the Freedman's Bureau; however, Johnson vetoed the Freedmen's Bureau Bill in February 1866.  Although Johnson had sympathies for the plights of the freedmen, he was against federal assistance.  An attempt to override the veto failed on February 20, 1866.  This veto shocked the Congressional Radicals.  In response, both the Senate and House passed a joint resolution not to allow any Senator or Representative seat admittance until Congress decided when Reconstruction was finished.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schouler 1913 43–57&quot;/&gt;

Senator [[Lyman Trumbull]] of [[Illinois]], leader of the moderate Republicans, took affront at the black codes. He proposed the first Civil Rights Law, because the abolition of slavery was empty if
&lt;blockquote&gt;laws are to be enacted and enforced depriving persons of African descent of privileges which are essential to freemen&amp;nbsp;... A law that does not allow a colored person to go from one county to another, and one that does not allow him to hold property, to teach, to preach, are certainly laws in violation of the rights of a freeman&amp;nbsp;... The purpose of this bill is to destroy all these discriminations.&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes, ''History'' 6:65–66&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The key to the bill was the opening section:
&lt;blockquote&gt;All persons born in the United States&amp;nbsp;... are hereby declared to be citizens of the United States; and such citizens of every race and color, without regard to any previous condition of slavery&amp;nbsp;... shall have the same right in every State&amp;nbsp;... to make and enforce contracts, to sue, be parties, and give evidence, to inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold, and convey real and personal property, and to full and equal benefit of all laws and proceedings for the security of person and property, as is enjoyed by white citizens, and shall be subject to like punishment, pains, and penalties and to none other, any law, statute, ordinance, regulation, or custom to the Contrary notwithstanding.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Congress quickly passed the Civil Rights bill; the Senate on February 2 voted 33–12; the House on March 13 voted 111–38.

===Johnson's vetoes===
Although strongly urged by moderates in Congress to sign the Civil Rights bill, Johnson broke decisively with them by vetoing it on March 27, 1866. His veto message objected to the measure because it conferred citizenship on the freedmen at a time when eleven out of thirty-six states were unrepresented and attempted to fix by Federal law &quot;a perfect equality of the white and black races in every State of the Union.&quot; Johnson said it was an invasion by Federal authority of the rights of the States; it had no warrant in the Constitution and was contrary to all precedents. It was a &quot;stride toward centralization and the concentration of all legislative power in the national government.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes, ''History'' 6:68&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Freedman's bureau.jpg|thumb|250px|The debate over reconstruction and the [[Freedman's Bureau]] was nationwide. This 1866 Pennsylvania election poster alleged that the Bureau kept the Negro in idleness at the expense of the hard working white taxpayer.  A racist [[caricature]] of an African American is depicted.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/reconstruction/section4/section4_11.html] based ''America's Reconstruction: People and Politics After the Civil War'', by Eric Foner and Olivia Mahoney. Online source is: [http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/reconstruction/credits.html]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The Democratic Party, proclaiming itself the party of white men, north and south, supported Johnson.&lt;ref&gt;Trefousse 1989&lt;/ref&gt; However the Republicans in Congress overrode his veto (the Senate by the close vote of 33:15, the House by 122:41) and the Civil Rights bill became law. Congress also passed a toned-down Freedmen's Bureau Bill; Johnson quickly vetoed as he had done to the previous bill. This time, however, Congress had enough support and overrode Johnson's veto.

The last moderate proposal was the Fourteenth Amendment, whose principal drafter was Representative [[John Bingham]]. It was designed to put the key provisions of the Civil Rights Act into the Constitution, but it went much further. It extended citizenship to everyone born in the United States (except visitors and [[Native Americans in the United States|Indians]] on reservations), penalized states that did not give the vote to freedmen, and most importantly, created new federal civil rights that could be protected by federal courts. It guaranteed the Federal war debt would be paid (and promised the Confederate debt would never be paid). Johnson used his influence to block the amendment in the states since three-fourths of the states were required for ratification (the amendment was later ratified.). The moderate effort to compromise with Johnson had failed, and a political fight broke out between the Republicans (both Radical and moderate) on one side, and on the other side, Johnson and his allies in the Democratic party in the North, and the conservative groupings (which used different names) in each southern state.

==Congress imposes Radical Reconstruction==
Concerned that President Johnson viewed Congress as an &quot;illegal body&quot; and was attempting to overthrow the government, Republicans in Congress took control of Reconstruction policies after the election of 1866.&lt;ref&gt;Badeau (1887) ''Grant in Peace'', pp. 46, 57&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson ignored the policy mandate, and he openly encouraged southern states to deny ratification of the 14th Amendment (except for Tennessee, all former Confederate states did refuse to ratify, as did the border states of Delaware, Maryland and Kentucky). Radical Republicans in Congress, led by Stevens and Sumner, opened the way to suffrage for male freedmen. They were generally in control, although they had to compromise with the moderate Republicans (the Democrats in Congress had almost no power). Historians generally refer to this period as ''Radical Reconstruction.''&lt;ref&gt;Fellman (2003), p. 301–310; Foner (1988) entitles his chapter 6, &quot;The Making of Radical Reconstruction.&quot; Trefousse (1968) and Hyman (1967) put &quot;Radical Republicans&quot; in the title. Benedict (1974) argues the Radical Republicans were conservative on many other issues.&lt;/ref&gt;

The South's white leaders, who held power in the immediate postwar era before the vote was granted to the freedmen, renounced secession and slavery, but not white supremacy. People who had previously held power were angered in 1867 when new elections were held. New Republican lawmakers were elected by a coalition of white Unionists, freedmen and northerners who had settled in the South. Some leaders in the South tried to accommodate to new conditions.

===Constitutional amendments===
Three Constitutional amendments, known as the Reconstruction Amendments, were adopted. The 13th Amendment abolishing slavery was ratified in 1865. The 14th Amendment was proposed in 1866 and ratified in 1868, guaranteeing [[United States citizenship]] to all persons born or naturalized in the United States and granting them federal [[civil rights]]. The 15th Amendment, proposed in late February 1869 and passed in early February 1870, decreed that the right to vote could not be denied because of &quot;race, color, or previous condition of servitude&quot;. The amendment did not declare the vote an unconditional right; it prohibited these types of discrimination. States would still determine voter registration and electoral laws.  The amendments were directed at ending slavery and providing full citizenship to freedmen. Northern Congressmen believed that providing black men with the right to vote would be the most rapid means of political education and training.

Many blacks took an active part in voting and political life, and rapidly continued to build churches and community organizations. Following Reconstruction, white conservative Democrats and insurgent groups used force to regain power in the state legislatures, and pass laws that effectively [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era (United States)|disfranchised]] most blacks and many poor whites in the South. At the turn of the century, from 1890 to 1910, southern states passed new constitutions that completed disfranchisement of blacks. Early Supreme Court rulings on these provisions upheld many of these new southern constitutions and laws, and most blacks were prevented from voting in the South until the 1960s. Full federal enforcement of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments did not occur until after passage of legislation in the mid-1960s as a result of the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955–1968)]].

===Statutes===
The [[Reconstruction Acts]] as originally passed, were initially called [http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&amp;fileName=014/llsl014.db&amp;recNum=459 &quot;An act to provide for the more efficient Government of the Rebel States&quot;] the legislation was enacted by the 39th Congress, on March 2, 1867. It was vetoed by President Johnson, and the veto overridden by two-thirds majority, in both the House and the Senate, the same day.  Congress also clarified the scope of the federal writ of [[habeas corpus]] to allow federal courts to vacate unlawful state court convictions or sentences in 1867 (28 U.S.C. §2254).

===Military reconstruction===&lt;!-- This section is linked from Arkansas --&gt;
[[File:Jesse and Frank James.gif|thumb|upright|The [[James-Younger Gang]] had its origins in a group of Confederate [[Bushwhacker|guerrillas]].]]
With the Radicals in control, Congress passed the [[Reconstruction Act]]s on July 19, 1867.  The first Reconstruction Act, authored by Oregon Sen. [[George Henry Williams|George H. Williams]], a [[Radical Republican]], placed ten Confederate states under military control, grouping them into five military districts:&lt;ref&gt;Foner 1988, ch. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[First Military District]]: Virginia, under General [[John Schofield]]
* [[Second Military District]]: North Carolina and South Carolina, under General [[Daniel Sickles]]
* [[Third Military District]]: Georgia, Alabama and Florida, under General [[John Pope (military officer)|John Pope]] and [[George Meade]]
* [[Fourth Military District]]: Arkansas and Mississippi, under General [[Edward Ord]]
* [[Fifth Military District]]: Texas and Louisiana, under Generals [[Philip Sheridan]] and [[Winfield Scott Hancock]]

20,000 U.S. troops were deployed to enforce the Act.

Tennessee was not made part of a military district (having already been readmitted to the Union), and therefore federal controls did not apply.

The ten Southern state governments were re-constituted under the direct control of the United States Army. One major purpose was to recognize and protect the right of African Americans to vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|ssrn=589301 |title=Gabriel J. Chin, &quot;The 'Voting Rights Act of 1867': The Constitutionality of Federal Regulation of Suffrage During Reconstruction,&quot; 82 North Carolina Law Review 1581 (2004) |publisher=Papers.ssrn.com |date=September 14, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There was little or no combat, but rather a state of [[martial law]] in which the military closely supervised local government, supervised elections, and tried to protect office holders and freedmen from violence.&lt;ref&gt;Foner 1988, ch. 6–7.&lt;/ref&gt;  Blacks were enrolled as voters; former Confederate leaders were excluded for a limited period.&lt;ref&gt;Foner 1988, p. 274–275.&lt;/ref&gt; No one state was entirely representative. Randolph Campbell describes what happened in Texas:&lt;ref&gt;Randolph Campbell, ''Gone to Texas'' 2003 p. 276.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The first critical step&amp;nbsp;... was the registration of voters according to guidelines established by Congress and interpreted by Generals Sheridan and Charles Griffin. The Reconstruction Acts called for registering all adult males, white and black, except those who had ever sworn an oath to uphold the Constitution of the United States and then engaged in rebellion&amp;nbsp;... Sheridan interpreted these restrictions stringently, barring from registration not only all pre-1861 officials of state and local governments who had supported the Confederacy but also all city officeholders and even minor functionaries such as sextons of cemeteries. In May Griffin&amp;nbsp;... appointed a three-man board of registrars for each county, making his choices on the advice of known scalawags and local Freedman's Bureau agents. In every county where practicable a freedman served as one of the three registrars&amp;nbsp;... Final registration amounted to approximately 59,633 whites and 49,479 blacks. It is impossible to say how many whites were rejected or refused to register (estimates vary from 7,500 to 12,000), but blacks, who constituted only about 30 percent of the state's population, were significantly overrepresented at 45 percent of all voters.&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes (1920) v 6 p. 199&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

All Southern states were readmitted to representation in Congress by the end of 1870, the last being Georgia. All but 500 top Confederate leaders were pardoned when President Grant signed the [[Amnesty Act of 1872]].

==Grant: the Radical President==
{{Main|Presidency of Ulysses S. Grant}}
[[File:Ug18.gif|thumb|left|upright|President Ulysses S. Grant&lt;p&gt;18th President of the United States&lt;p&gt;'''''1869–1877''''']]
During the Civil War, many in the North believed that fighting for the Union was a noble cause – for the preservation of the Union and the end of slavery.  After the war ended, with the North victorious, the fear among Radicals was that President Johnson too quickly assumed that slavery and Confederate nationalism were dead and that the southern states could return. The Radicals sought out a candidate for President who represented their viewpoint.&lt;ref&gt;Brogan (1985), ''The Penguin History of the United States of America'', p. 357–358; Smith (2001), ''Grant'', pp. 455–457&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1868, the Republicans unanimously chose Ulysses S. Grant to be the Republican Presidential candidate. Grant won favor with the Radicals after he allowed [[Edwin M. Stanton]], a Radical, to be reinstated as Secretary of War.  As early as 1862, during the Civil War, Grant had appointed the Ohio military chaplain [[John Eaton (General)|John Eaton]] to protect and gradually incorporate refugee slaves in west Tennessee and northern Mississippi into the Union War effort, and pay them for their labor. It was the beginning of his vision for the [[Freedmen's Bureau]].&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, Brooks D. &quot;Ulysses S. Grant and the Freedmen’s Bureau&quot;, in ''The Freedmen’s Bureau and Reconstruction: Reconsiderations'', edited by Paul A. Cimbala and Randall M. Miller. New York: Fordham University Press, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;  Grant opposed President Johnson by supporting the Reconstruction Acts passed by the Radicals.&lt;ref&gt;Smith (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Grant'', pp. 437–453, 458–460&lt;/ref&gt;

Immediately upon Inauguration in 1869, Grant bolstered Reconstruction by prodding Congress to readmit [[Virginia]], [[Mississippi]], and [[Texas]] into the Union, while ensuring their constitutions protected every citizens voting rights.&lt;ref name=Spxiii&gt;Simon (1967), ''Papers of Ulysses S. Grant'', Volume 19, pp. xiii&lt;/ref&gt; Grant met with prominent black leaders for consultation, and signed a bill into law that guaranteed equal rights to both blacks and whites in [[Washington D.C.]]&lt;ref name=Spxiii/&gt; In Grant's two terms he strengthened Washington's legal capabilities. He worked with Congress to create the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] and Office of [[Solicitor General of the United States|Solicitor General]], led by Attorney General [[Amos Akerman]] and the first Solicitor General [[Benjamin Bristow]], who both prosecuted thousands of Klansmen under the [[Force Acts]]. Grant sent additional federal troops to nine South Carolina counties to suppress Klan violence in 1871. In 1872, Grant was the first American President to legally recognize an [[African American]] governor, [[Pinckney Benton Stewart Pinchback|P. B. S. Pinchback]] of [[Louisiana]].&lt;ref name=N-M-F_p272&gt;Norris-Milligin-Faulk, p. 272&lt;/ref&gt; Grant also used military pressure to ensure that African Americans could maintain their new electoral status; won passage of the Fifteenth Amendment giving African Americans the right to vote; and signed the [[Civil Rights Act of 1875]] giving people access to public facilities regardless of race.  To counter vote fraud in the Democratic stronghold of New York City, Grant sent in  tens of thousands of armed, uniformed federal marshals and other election officials to regulate the 1870 and subsequent elections. Democrats across the North then mobilized to defend their base and attacked Grant's entire set of policies.&lt;ref&gt;David Quigley, &quot;Constitutional Revision and the City: The Enforcement Acts and Urban America, 1870–1894,&quot; ''Journal of Policy History,'' January 2008, Vol. 20 Issue 1, pp 64–75&lt;/ref&gt; On October 21, 1876 President Grant deployed troops to protect black and white Republican voters in Petersburg, Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Blair|Blair]] (2005), p. 400&lt;/ref&gt;

Grant's support from Congress and the nation declined due to presidential scandals during his administration and the political resurgence of the Democrats in the North and South.  Furthermore most Republicans felt the war goals had been achieved by 1870 and turned their attention to other issues such as financial and monetary policies.&lt;ref&gt;Smith (2001), ''Grant'', p. 547&lt;/ref&gt;

==Congressional investigation (1871–1872)==
On April 20, 1871, the U.S. Congress launched a 21-member investigation committee on the status of the Southern Reconstruction states: North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida.  Congressional members on the committee included Rep. [[Benjamin Franklin Butler (politician)|Benjamin Butler]], Sen. [[Zachariah Chandler]], and Sen. [[Francis P. Blair]]. Subcommittee members traveled into the South to interview the people living in their respective states. Those interviewed included top-ranking officials, such as [[Wade Hampton III|Wade Hampton]], former South Carolina Gov. [[James L. Orr]], and [[Nathan Bedford Forrest|Nathan B. Forrest]], a former Confederate general and prominent Ku Klux Klan leader. Others southerners interviewed included farmers, doctors, merchants, teachers, and clergymen.  The committee heard numerous reports of white violence against blacks, while many whites denied Klan membership or knowledge of violent activities. The majority report by Republicans concluded that the government would not tolerate any Southern &quot;conspiracy&quot; to resist violently the Congressional Reconstruction. The committee completed its 13-volume report in February 1872. While Grant had been able to suppress the KKK through the Force Acts, other [[paramilitary]] [[insurgents]] organized, including the [[White League]] in 1874, active in Louisiana; and the [[Red Shirts (Southern United States)|Red Shirts]], with chapters active in Mississippi and the Carolinas.  They used intimidation and outright attacks to run Republicans out of office and repress voting by blacks, leading to white Democrats regaining power by the elections of the mid-to-late 1870s.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Franklin|Franklin]] (1961), pp. 168–173&lt;/ref&gt;

*Georgia – July 15, 1870

==African-American officeholders==
Republicans took control of all Southern state governorships and state legislatures, except for Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;Georgia had a Republican governor and legislature, but the Republican hegemony was tenuous at best, and Democrats continued to win presidential elections there. See [http://georgiainfo.galileo.usg.edu/tdgh-mar/mar28.htm 1834 March 28 article in ''This Day in Georgia History''] compiled by Ed Jackson and Charles Pou; ''cf.'' [[Rufus Bullock]].&lt;/ref&gt; The Republican coalition elected numerous African Americans to local, state, and national offices; though they did not dominate any electoral offices, black men as representatives voting in state and federal legislatures marked a drastic social change. At the beginning of 1867, no African-American in the South held political office,  but within three or four years &quot;about 15 percent of the officeholders in the South were black—a larger proportion than in 1990.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;mcpherson1&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title=Abraham Lincoln and the Second American Revolution | publisher=Oxford University Press | author=McPherson, James M. | year=1992 | pages=19 | isbn=978-0-19-507606-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;   About 137 black officeholders had lived outside the South before the Civil War. Some had escaped from slavery to the North, become educated, and returned to help the South advance in the postwar era. Others were free blacks before the war, who had achieved education and positions of leadership elsewhere. Other African-American men who served were already leaders in their communities, including a number of preachers. As happened in white communities, not all leadership depended upon wealth and literacy.&lt;ref&gt;Foner 1988, ch 7; Foner, ''Freedom's Lawmakers'', introduction.&lt;/ref&gt;

There were few African Americans elected or appointed to national office. African Americans voted for white candidates and for blacks.  The [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] guaranteed the right to vote, but did not guarantee that the vote would be counted, that the districts would be apportioned equally, or that voters would be free from intimidation and violence. As a result, states with majority African-American population often elected only one or two African-American representatives in Congress. Exceptions included South Carolina; at the end of Reconstruction, four of its five Congressmen were African American.

==Public schools==
[[W. E. B. Du Bois]] argued that the freedmen had a deep commitment to education and that African Americans in the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] coalition played a critical role in establishing the principal of universal public education in state constitutions during congressional Reconstruction.&lt;ref&gt;W. E. B. Du Bois, ''Black Reconstruction in America, 1860–1880''. (1935)&lt;/ref&gt; Some slaves learned to read from white playmates although formal education was not allowed by law; African Americans started &quot;native schools&quot; before the end of the war; Sabbath schools were another widespread means freedmen created for teaching literacy.&lt;ref&gt;James D. Anderson, ''The Education of Blacks in the South, 1860–1935''. (1988), pp.&amp;nbsp;6–15&lt;/ref&gt; When they gained suffrage, black politicians took this commitment to public education to state constitutional conventions.

African Americans and white Republicans joined to build education at the state level. They created a system of public schools, which were segregated by race everywhere except New Orleans.  Generally, elementary and a few secondary schools were built in most cities, and occasionally in the countryside, but the South had few cities.  

The rural areas faced many difficulties opening and maintaining public schools.  In the country, the public school was often a one-room affair that attracted about half the younger children. The teachers were poorly paid, and their pay was often in arrears.&lt;ref&gt;Foner 365–8&lt;/ref&gt; Conservatives contended the rural schools were too expensive and unnecessary for a region where the vast majority of people were cotton or tobacco farmers. They had no vision of a better future for their residents.  One historian found that the schools were less effective than they might have been because &quot;poverty, the inability of the states to collect taxes, and inefficiency and corruption in many places prevented successful operation of the schools.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Franklin 139&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Seymour US Reconstruction antidem poster.jpg|thumb|300px|1868 Republican cartoon identifies Democratic candidate [[Horatio Seymour]] (right panel) with KKK violence and with Confederate soldiers]]

Numerous private academies and colleges for freedmen were established by northern missionaries. Every state created state colleges for freedmen, such as [[Alcorn State University]] in Mississippi. The state colleges created generations of teachers who were critical in the education of African American children.

In 1890, the black state colleges started receiving federal funds as land grant schools.  They received state funds after Reconstruction ended because, as Lynch explains, &quot;there are very many liberal, fair-minded and influential Democrats in the State who are strongly in favor of having the State provide for the liberal education of both races.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lynch 1913&quot;&gt;Lynch 1913&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;B. D. Mayberry, ''A Century of Agriculture in the 1890 Land Grant Institutions and Tuskegee University, 1890–1990'' (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Railroad subsidies and payoffs==
[[File:Atlanta roundhouse ruin3.jpg|thumb|left|Atlanta's railyard and roundhouse in ruins shortly after the end of the Civil War.]]
Every Southern state subsidized railroads, which modernizers felt could haul the South out of isolation and poverty.  Millions of dollars in bonds and subsidies were fraudulently pocketed. One ring in North Carolina spent $200,000 in bribing the legislature and obtained millions in state money for its railroads. Instead of building new track, however, it used the funds to speculate in bonds, reward friends with extravagant fees, and enjoy lavish trips to Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Foner 387&lt;/ref&gt; Taxes were quadrupled across the South to pay off the railroad bonds and the school costs.  There were complaints among taxpayers, because taxes had historically been low, since there was so little commitment to public works or public education.  Taxes historically had been much lower than in the North, reflecting a lack of public investment in the communities.&lt;ref&gt;Franklin pp&amp;nbsp;141–48; Summers 1984&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless thousands of miles of lines were built as the Southern system expanded from 11,000 miles (17,700&amp;nbsp;km) in 1870 to 29,000 miles (46,700&amp;nbsp;km) in 1890. The lines were owned and directed overwhelmingly by Northerners.  Railroads helped create a mechanically skilled group of craftsmen and broke the isolation of much of the region. Passengers were few, however, and apart from hauling the cotton crop when it was harvested, there was little freight traffic.&lt;ref&gt;Stover 1955&lt;/ref&gt; As Franklin explains, &quot;numerous railroads fed at the public trough by bribing legislators&amp;nbsp;... and through the use and misuse of state funds.&quot; The effect, according to one businessman, &quot;was to drive capital from the State, paralyze industry, and demoralize labor.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Franklin p147–8&lt;/ref&gt;

==Taxation during Reconstruction==
Reconstruction changed the tax structure of the South. In the U.S. from the earliest days until today, a major source of state revenue was the [[property tax]]. In the South, wealthy landowners were allowed to self-assess the value of their own land. These fraudulent assessments were almost valueless, and pre-war property tax collections were lacking due to property value misrepresentation. State revenues came from fees and from sales taxes on slave auctions.&lt;ref&gt;Foner 375&lt;/ref&gt; Some states assessed property owners by a combination of [[land value tax|land value]] and a capitation tax, a tax on each worker employed. This tax was often assessed in a way to discourage a free labor market, where a slave was assessed at 75 cents, while a free white was assessed at a dollar or more, and a free African American at $3 or more. Some revenue also came from [[poll tax]]es. These taxes were more than poor people could pay, with the designed and inevitable consequence that they did not vote.

During Reconstruction, new spending on schools and infrastructure, combined with fraudulent spending and a collapse in state credit because of huge deficits, forced the states to dramatically increase property tax rates. In places, the rate went up to ten times higher—despite the poverty of the region. The infrastructure of much of the South—roads, bridges, and railroads—scarce and deficient even before the war—had been destroyed during the war. In addition, there were other new expenditures, because pre-war southern states did not educate their citizens or build and maintain much infrastructure. In part, the new tax system was designed to force owners of large estates with huge tracts of uncultivated land either to sell or to have it confiscated for failure to pay taxes.&lt;ref&gt;Foner 376&lt;/ref&gt; The taxes would serve as a market-based system for redistributing the land to the landless freedmen and white poor.

Here is a table of property tax rates for South Carolina and Mississippi. Note that many local town and county assessments effectively doubled the tax rates reported in the table. These taxes were still levied upon the landowners' own sworn testimony as to the value of their land, which remained the dubious and exploitable system used by wealthy landholders in the South well into the 20th century.

Called upon to pay an actual tax on their property, angry plantation owners revolted. The conservatives shifted their focus away from race to taxes.&lt;ref&gt;Foner 415–16&lt;/ref&gt; Former Congressman [[John R. Lynch]], a black Republican leader from Mississippi, concluded,
:The argument made by the taxpayers, however, was plausible and it may be conceded that, upon the whole, they were about right; for no doubt it would have been much easier upon the taxpayers to have increased at that time the interest-bearing debt of the State than to have increased the tax rate. The latter course, however, had been adopted and could not then be changed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lynch 1913&quot;/&gt;

==Conservative Democrat reaction==
The fact that their former slaves now held political and military power angered many whites.   They self-consciously defended their own actions within the framework of an Anglo-American discourse of resistance against tyrannical government, and they broadly succeeded in convincing fellow (white) citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Marek D. Steedman, &quot;Resistance, Rebirth, and Redemption: The Rhetoric of White Supremacy in Post-Civil War Louisiana,&quot; ''Historical Reflections,'' Spring 2009, Vol. 35#1, pp 97–113&lt;/ref&gt; They formed new political parties (often with the intention to contest elections), and supported or tolerated violent activist groups that intimidated both black and white Republican leaders at election time.  By the mid 1870s, the Conservative Democrats had aligned with the national Democratic Party, which enthusiastically supported their cause even as the national Republican Party was losing interest in Southern affairs. Historian [[Walter Lynwood Fleming]] describes mounting anger of Southern whites:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Negro troops, even at their best, were everywhere considered offensive by the native whites&amp;nbsp;... The Negro soldier, impudent by reason of his new freedom, his new uniform, and his new gun, was more than Southern temper could tranquilly bear, and race conflicts were frequent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Often, these parties called themselves the &quot;Conservative Party&quot; or the &quot;Democratic and Conservative Party&quot; in order to distinguish themselves from the national Democratic Party and to obtain support from former Whigs.  These parties sent delegates to the [[1868 Democratic National Convention]] and abandoned their separate names by 1873 or 1874.&lt;ref&gt;Perman 1984, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

Most [white] members of both the planter/business class and common farmer class of the South opposed black power, Carpetbaggers and military rule, and sought white supremacy. Democrats nominated blacks for political office and tried to steal other blacks from the Republican side.  When these attempts to combine with the blacks failed, the planters joined the common farmers in simply trying to displace the Republican governments.  The planters and their business allies dominated the self-styled &quot;conservative: coalition that finally took control in the South. They were paternalistic toward the blacks but feared they would use power to raise taxes and slow business development.&lt;ref&gt;[[T. Harry Williams]], ''An Analysis of Some Reconstruction Attitudes,&quot; ''Journal of Southern History'' Vol. 12, No. 4 (Nov., 1946), pp. 469–486 [http://www.jstor.org/stable/2197687 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

Fleming is a typical example of the conservative interpretation of Reconstruction. His work defended some roles in opposing military oppression by the white supremacist group the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) but denounced the Klan's violence. Fleming accepted as necessary the disenfranchisement of African Americans because he thought their votes were bought and sold by Carpetbaggers. Fleming described the first results of the movement as &quot;good&quot; and the later ones as &quot;both good and bad.&quot; According to Fleming (1907) the KKK &quot;quieted the Negroes, made life and property safer, gave protection to women, stopped burnings, forced the Radical leaders to be more moderate, made the Negroes work better, drove the worst of the Radical leaders from the country and started the whites on the way to gain political supremacy.&quot;

The evil result, Fleming said, was that lawless elements &quot;made use of the organization as a cloak to cover their misdeeds&amp;nbsp;... the lynching habits of today [1907] are largely to conditions, social and legal, growing out of Reconstruction.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Walter Lynwood Fleming, ''Documentary History of the Reconstruction (Cleveland, 1907), II, pp. 328–9&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ellis Paxson Oberholtzer]] (a northern scholar) in 1917 explained:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Outrages upon the former slaves in the South there were in plenty. Their sufferings were many. But white men, too, were victims of lawless violence, and in all portions of the North and the late &quot;rebel&quot; states. Not a political campaign passed without the exchange of bullets, the breaking of skulls with sticks and stones, the firing of rival club-houses. Republican clubs marched the streets of Philadelphia, amid revolver shots and brickbats, to save the negroes from the &quot;rebel&quot; savages in Alabama&amp;nbsp;... The project to make voters out of black men was not so much for their social elevation as for the further punishment of the Southern white people—for the capture of offices for Radical scamps and the entrenchment of the Radical party in power for a long time to come in the South and in the country at large.&lt;ref&gt;Oberholtzer, vol 1 p 485&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Reaction by the angry whites included the formation of violent secret societies, especially the KKK.  Violence occurred in cities with Democrats, Conservatives and other angry whites on one side and Republicans, African-Americans, federal government representatives, and Republican-organized armed [[Loyal Leagues]] on the other. The victims of this violence were overwhelmingly African American. The Klan and other such groups were careful to avoid federal legal intervention or military conflict. Their election-time tactics included violent intimidation of African American and Republican voters prior to elections while avoiding conflict with the U.S. Army or the state militias and then withdrawing completely on election day.  Conservative reaction continued in both the north and south; the &quot;white liners&quot; movement to elect candidates dedicated to white supremacy reached as far as [[Ohio]] in 1875.&lt;ref&gt;Trelease, ''White Terror''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McFeely (2002), '''''Grant: A Biography''''', pp. 420–422&lt;/ref&gt;

==Redemption 1873–77==

===Republicans split nationally: election of 1872===
As early as 1868 Supreme Court Chief Justice [[Salmon P. Chase]], a leading Radical during the war, concluded that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Congress was right in not limiting, by its reconstruction acts, the right of suffrage to whites; but wrong in the exclusion from suffrage of certain classes of citizens and all unable to take its prescribed retrospective oath, and wrong also in the establishment of despotic military governments for the States and in authorizing military commissions for the trial of civilians in time of peace. There should have been as little military government as possible; no military commissions; no classes excluded from suffrage; and no oath except one of faithful obedience and support to the Constitution and laws, and of sincere attachment to the constitutional Government of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;J. W. Schuckers, ''The Life and Public Services of Salmon Portland Chase,'' (1874). p. 585; letter of May 30, 1868 to August Belmont&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By 1872, President Ulysses S. Grant had alienated large numbers of leading Republicans, including many Radicals by the corruption of his administration and his use of federal soldiers to prop up Radical state regimes in the South. The opponents, called [[Liberal Republican Party (United States)|&quot;Liberal Republicans&quot;]], included founders of the party who expressed dismay that the party had succumbed to corruption. They were further wearied by the continued insurgent violence of whites against blacks in the South, especially around every election cycle, which demonstrated the war was not over and changes were fragile.  Leaders included editors of some of the nation's most powerful newspapers. Charles Sumner, embittered by the corruption of the Grant administration, joined the new party, which nominated editor [[Horace Greeley]]. The badly organized Democratic party also supported Greeley.

Grant made up for the defections by new gains among Union veterans and by strong support from the &quot;[[Stalwart (politics)|Stalwart]]&quot; faction of his party (which depended on his patronage), and the Southern Republican parties.  Grant won with 55.6% of the vote to Greeley's 43.8%. The Liberal Republican party vanished and many former supporters—even former abolitionists—abandoned the cause of Reconstruction.&lt;ref&gt;McPherson 1975&lt;/ref&gt;

===Republican coalition splinters in South===
In the South, political–racial tensions built up inside the Republican party as they were attacked by the Democrats. In 1868, Georgia Democrats, with support from some Republicans, expelled all 28 black Republican members{{clarify|date=August 2011}}, arguing blacks were eligible to vote but not to hold office. In several states, the more conservative scalawags fought for control with the more radical carpetbaggers and usually lost. Thus, in Mississippi, the conservative faction led by scalawag [[James Lusk Alcorn]] was decisively defeated by the radical faction led by carpetbagger [[Adelbert Ames]]. The party lost support steadily as many scalawags left it; few recruits were acquired. Meanwhile, the freedmen were demanding a bigger share of the offices and patronage, thus squeezing out their carpetbagger allies.&lt;ref&gt;Foner 537–41&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, some of the more prosperous freedmen were joining the Democrats, as they were angered at the failure of the Republicans to help them acquire land.&lt;ref&gt;Foner 374–5&lt;/ref&gt;

Although historians such as W. E. B. Du Bois looked for and celebrated a cross-racial coalition of poor whites and blacks, such coalitions rarely formed in these years. Writing in 1915, former Congressman Lynch, recalling his experience as a black leader in Mississippi, explained that,
&lt;blockquote&gt;While the colored men did not look with favor upon a political alliance with the poor whites, it must be admitted that, with very few exceptions, that class of whites did not seek, and did not seem to desire such an alliance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lynch 1915&quot;&gt;Lynch 1915&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Lynch reported that poor whites resented the job competition from freedmen. Furthermore, the poor whites
&lt;blockquote&gt;with a few exceptions, were less efficient, less capable, and knew less about matters of state and governmental administration than many of the former slaves.… As a rule, therefore, the whites that came into the leadership of the Republican party between 1872 and 1875 were representatives of the most substantial families of the land.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lynch 1915&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Democrats try a &quot;New Departure&quot;===
[[File:A republican form of government and no domestic violence.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''A Republican Form of Government and No Domestic Violence''&lt;br /&gt;by [[Thomas Nast]]&lt;br /&gt;A political cartoon about the (Wheeler) Compromise in Louisiana&lt;br /&gt;published in [[Harper's Weekly]]&lt;br /&gt;March 6, 1875]]
By 1870, the Democratic–Conservative leadership across the South decided it had to end its opposition to Reconstruction and black suffrage to survive and move on to new issues.  The Grant administration had proven by its crackdown on the Ku Klux Klan that it would use as much federal power as necessary to suppress open anti-black violence.  The Democrats in the North concurred. They wanted to fight the Republican Party on economic grounds rather than race. The [[New Departure (Democrats)|New Departure]] offered the chance for a clean slate without having to re-fight the Civil War every election. Furthermore, many wealthy landowners thought they could control part of the newly enfranchised black electorate to their own advantage.

Not all Democrats agreed; an insurgent element continued to resist Reconstruction no matter what. Eventually, a group called &quot;Redeemers&quot; took control of the party in the Southern states.&lt;ref&gt;Perman 1984, ch 3&lt;/ref&gt; They formed coalitions with conservative Republicans, including scalawags and carpetbaggers, emphasizing the need for economic modernization. Railroad building was seen as a panacea since northern capital was needed. The new tactics were a success in [[History of Virginia|Virginia]] where [[William Mahone]] built a winning coalition.  In Tennessee, the Redeemers formed a coalition with Republican governor [[Dewitt Clinton Senter|DeWitt Senter]]. Across the South, some Democrats switched from the race issue to taxes and corruption, charging that Republican governments were corrupt and inefficient.  With continuing decrease in cotton prices, taxes squeezed cash-poor farmers who rarely saw $20 in currency a year but had to pay taxes in currency or lose their farm.

In North Carolina, Republican Governor [[William Woods Holden]] used state troops against the Klan, but the prisoners were released by federal judges. Holden became the first governor in American history to be impeached and removed from office. Republican political disputes in Georgia split the party and enabled the Redeemers to take over.&lt;ref&gt;Foner, ch 9&lt;/ref&gt;

In the lower South, violence continued and new insurgent groups arose. The disputed election in Louisiana in 1872 found both Republican and Democratic candidates holding inaugural balls while returns were reviewed.  Both certified their own slates for local parish offices in many places, causing local tensions to rise. Finally, Federal support helped certify the Republican as governor, but the Democrat [[Samuel D. McEnery]] in March 1873 brought his own militia to bear in New Orleans, the seat of government.

Slates for local offices were certified by each candidate.  In rural [[Grant Parish]] in the [[Red River Valley]], freedmen fearing a Democratic attempt to take over the parish government reinforced defenses at the Colfax courthouse in late March.  White militias gathered from the area a few miles outside the settlement. Rumors and fears abounded on both sides. William Ward, an African-American Union veteran and militia captain, mustered his company in [[Colfax, Louisiana|Colfax]] and went to the courthouse. On Easter Sunday, April 13, 1873, the whites attacked the defenders at the courthouse. There was confusion about who shot one of the white leaders after an offer by the defenders to surrender.  It was a catalyst to mayhem.  In the end, three whites died and 120–150 blacks were killed, some 50 were held as prisoners.  The disproportionate numbers of black to white fatalities and documentation of brutalized bodies are why contemporary historians call it the Colfax Massacre rather than the Colfax Riot, as it is known locally.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Lemann, ''Redemption: The Last Battle of the Civil War'', New York: Farrar, Strauss &amp; Giroux, Pbk. 2007, pp.&amp;nbsp;15–21&lt;/ref&gt;

This marked the beginning of heightened insurgency and attacks on Republican officeholders and freedmen in Louisiana and other Deep South states. In Louisiana, Judge T.S. Crawford and District Attorney P.H. Harris of the 12th Judicial District were shot off their horses and killed from ambush October 8, 1873, while going to court. One widow wrote to the Department of Justice that her husband was killed because he was a Union man and &quot;...&amp;nbsp;of the efforts made to screen those who committed a crime&amp;nbsp;...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;US Senate Journal January 13, 1875, pp.&amp;nbsp;106–107&lt;/ref&gt;

In the North, a live-and-let-live attitude made elections more like a sporting contest. But in the Deep South, many white citizens had not reconciled with the defeat of the war or the granting of citizenship to freedmen. As an Alabama scalawag explained,
:Our contest here is for life, for the right to earn our bread&amp;nbsp;... for a decent and respectful consideration as human beings and members of society.&lt;ref&gt;Foner p 443&lt;/ref&gt;

===Panic of 1873===
The Panic of 1873 (a [[Long Depression|depression]]) hit the Southern economy hard and disillusioned many Republicans who had gambled that railroads would pull the South out of its poverty.  The price of cotton fell by half; many small landowners, local merchants and cotton factors (wholesalers) went bankrupt. Sharecropping for black and white farmers became more common as a way to spread the risk of owning land. The old abolitionist element in the North was aging away, or had lost interest, and was not replenished.  Many carpetbaggers returned to the North or joined the Redeemers. Blacks had an increased voice in the Republican Party, but across the South it was divided by internal bickering and was rapidly losing its cohesion.  Many local black leaders started emphasizing individual economic progress in cooperation with white elites, rather than racial political progress in opposition to them, a conservative attitude that foreshadowed [[Booker T. Washington]].&lt;ref&gt;Foner p545–7&lt;/ref&gt;

Nationally, President Grant was blamed for the depression; the Republican Party lost 96 seats in all parts of the country in the [[United States House election, 1874|1874 elections]]. The [[Bourbon Democrats]] took control of the House and were confident of electing [[Samuel J. Tilden]] president in 1876. President Grant was not running for re-election and seemed to be losing interest in the South. States fell to the Redeemers, with only four in Republican hands in 1873, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi and South Carolina; Arkansas then fell after the violent [[Brooks–Baxter War]] in 1874 ripped apart the Republican party there.

===Paramilitary groups allied with Democratic Party===
In wide area of the South, secret societies sprang up with the aim of preventing blacks from voting and destroying the organization of the Republican party by assassinating local leaders and public officials. The most notorious such organization was the Ku Klux Klan, which in effect served as the military arm of the Democratic party in the South. It was led by planters, merchants, and Democratic politicians, men who liked to style themselves the South's &quot;respectable citizens.&quot;(Foner Give me liberty 504). 
Political violence had been endemic in Louisiana, but in 1874 the white militias coalesced into [[paramilitary organizations]] such as the White League, first in parishes of the Red River Valley.  A new organization operated openly and had political goals: the violent overthrow of Republican rule and suppression of black voting. White League chapters soon rose in many rural parishes, receiving financing for advanced weaponry from wealthy men. In one example of local violence, the White League assassinated six white Republican officeholders and five to twenty black witnesses outside [[Coushatta]], [[Red River Parish]] in 1874.

[[File:Harpers1874LouisianaOutrage.jpg|right|thumb|White Leaguers attacking the integrated police force and state militia, New Orleans, 1874]]
Later in 1874 the White League mounted a serious attempt to unseat the Republican governor of Louisiana, in a dispute that had simmered since the 1872 election.  It brought 5000 troops to New Orleans to engage and overwhelm forces of the Metropolitan Police and state militia to turn Republican Governor [[William P. Kellogg]] out of office and seat McEnery.  The White League took over and held the state house and city hall, but they retreated before the arrival of reinforcing Federal troops.  Kellogg had asked for reinforcements before, and Grant finally responded, sending additional troops to try to quell violence throughout plantation areas of the Red River Valley, although 2,000 troops were already in the state.&lt;ref&gt;Foner 555–56&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, the Red Shirts, another paramilitary group, arose in 1875 in Mississippi and the Carolinas. Like the White League and White Liner rifle clubs, these groups operated as a &quot;military arm of the Democratic Party&quot;, to restore white supremacy.&lt;ref name=&quot;George C. Rable 1984, p.132&quot;&gt;George C. Rable, ''But There Was No Peace: The Role of Violence in the Politics of Reconstruction'', Athens: University of Georgia Press, 1984, p.132&lt;/ref&gt;

Democrats and many northern Republicans agreed that Confederate nationalism and slavery were dead—the war goals were achieved—and further federal military interference was an undemocratic violation of historic Republican values. The victory of [[Rutherford Hayes]] in the hotly contested Ohio gubernatorial election of 1875 indicated his &quot;let alone&quot; policy toward the South would become Republican policy, as happened when he won the 1876 Republican nomination for president.

An explosion of violence accompanied the campaign for the [[Mississippi Plan|Mississippi's 1875 election]], in which Red Shirts and Democratic rifle clubs, operating in the open and without disguise, threatened or shot enough Republicans to decide the election for the Democrats.  Republican Governor Adelbert Ames asked Grant for federal troops to fight back; Grant initially refused, saying public opinion was &quot;tired out&quot; of the perpetual troubles in the South. Ames fled the state as the Democrats took over Mississippi.&lt;ref&gt;Foner ch 11&lt;/ref&gt;

This was not the end of the violence, however, as the campaigns and elections of 1876 were marked by additional murders and attacks on Republicans in Louisiana, North and South Carolina, and Florida.  In South Carolina the campaign season of 1876 was marked by murderous outbreaks and fraud against freedmen. Red Shirts paraded with arms behind Democratic candidates; they killed blacks in the [[Hamburg Massacre|Hamburg]] and [[Ellenton, South Carolina|Ellenton]] SC massacres; and one historian estimated 150 blacks were killed in the weeks before the 1876 election across South Carolina.  Red Shirts prevented almost all black voting in two majority-black counties.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Lemann, ''Redemption: The Last Battle of the Civil War'', New York: Farrar, Strauss &amp; Giroux, paperback, 2007, p.174&lt;/ref&gt; The Red Shirts were also active in North Carolina.

===Election of 1876===
Reconstruction continued in South Carolina, Louisiana and Florida until 1877. The elections of 1876 were accompanied by heightened violence across the Deep South. A combination of [[ballot stuffing]] and intimidating blacks suppressed their vote even in majority black counties. The White League was active in Louisiana.  After Republican Rutherford Hayes won the disputed [[U.S. presidential election, 1876|1876 presidential election]], the national Compromise of 1877 was reached.

The white Democrats in the South agreed to accept Hayes's victory if he withdrew the last Federal troops.  By this point, the North was weary of insurgency.  White Democrats controlled most of the Southern legislatures and armed militias controlled small towns and rural areas.  Blacks considered Reconstruction a failure because the Federal government withdrew from enforcing their ability to exercise their rights as citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Foner 604&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hayes: the last Reconstruction President==
[[File:Rhayes.png|thumb|175px|right|President [[Rutherford B. Hayes]]&lt;p&gt;19th President of the United States&lt;p&gt;'''''1877–1881''''']] On January 29, 1877 President Ulysses S. Grant signed the [[Electoral Commission (United States)|Electoral Commission Act]] that set up a 15-member commission to settle the disputed 1876 election of 8 Republicans and 7 Democrats.  The Electoral Commission awarded Rutherford B. Hayes the electoral votes he needed; Congress certified he had won by one electoral vote.  The Democrats had little leverage—they could not block Hayes' election, but they were mollified by the implicit, &quot;back room&quot; deal that federal troops would be removed on the condition that the Southern states pledged to protect the lives of African Americans. Hayes's friends also let it be known that he would promote Federal aid for [[internal improvements]], including help for a railroad in Texas, and name a Southerner to his cabinet. With the removal of Northern troops, the President had no method to enforce Reconstruction, thus this &quot;back room&quot; deal signaled the end of American Reconstruction.&lt;ref&gt;Woodward (1966), ''Reunion and reaction: the compromise of 1877 and the end of reconstruction'', pp. 3–15&lt;/ref&gt;

After assuming office on March 4, 1877, President Hayes removed troops from the capitals of the remaining Reconstruction states, Louisiana and South Carolina, allowing the Redeemers to have full control of these states. President Grant had already removed troops from Florida, before Hayes was inaugurated, and troops from the other Reconstruction states had long since been withdrawn. Hayes appointed [[David M. Key]] from Tennessee, a Southern Democrat, to the position of [[United States Postmaster General|Postmaster General]]. By 1879, thousands of African American &quot;exodusters&quot; packed up and headed to new opportunities in Kansas.&lt;ref&gt;Nell Irvin Painter, ''Exodusters: Black Migration to Kansas After Reconstruction'' (1976)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Democrats gained control of the Senate, and had complete control of Congress, having taken over the House in 1875. Hayes vetoed bills from the Democrats that outlawed the Republican Force Acts; however, with the military underfunded, Hayes could not adequately enforce these laws. Blacks remained involved in Southern politics, particularly in Virginia, which was run by the biracial [[Readjuster Party]].&lt;ref&gt;James T. Moore, &quot;Black Militancy in Readjuster Virginia, 1879–1883,&quot; ''Journal of Southern History'', Vol. 41, No. 2 (May 1975), pp. 167–186 [http://www.jstor.org/stable/2206012 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Numerous blacks were elected to local office through the 1880s, and in the 1890s in some states, biracial coalitions of Populists and Republicans briefly held control of state legislatures. In the last decade of the 19th century, southern states elected a total of five black US Congressmen, before disfranchising constitutions were passed throughout the former Confederacy.

==Legacy and historiography==
The interpretation of Reconstruction has been a topic of controversy. Nearly all historians hold that Reconstruction ended in failure but for different reasons. 

The first generation of Northern historians believed that the former Confederates were traitors and Johnson was their ally who threatened to undo the Union's constitutional achievements. By the 1880s, however, Northern historians argued that Johnson and his allies were not traitors but had blundered badly in rejecting the 14th Amendment and setting the stage for Radical Reconstruction.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher M. Green, &quot;Walter Lynwood Fleming: Historian of Reconstruction,&quot; ''The Journal of Southern History,'' Vol. 2, No. 4. (Nov., 1936), pp. 497–521.&lt;/ref&gt;

The black leader [[Booker T. Washington]], who grew up in [[West Virginia]] during Reconstruction, concluded later that, &quot;the Reconstruction experiment in racial democracy failed because it began at the wrong end, emphasizing political means and civil rights acts rather than economic means and self-determination.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Louis R. Harlan, ''Booker T. Washington in Perspective'' (1988) p. 164; A. A. Taylor, &quot;Historians of the Reconstruction,&quot; ''The Journal of Negro History'' Vol. 23, No. 1. (Jan., 1938), pp. 16–34.&lt;/ref&gt; His solution was to concentrate on building the economic infrastructure of the black community, in part by his leadership of [[Tuskegee Institute]].

The [[Dunning School]] of scholars, based at the history department of [[Columbia University]] analyzed Reconstruction as a failure after 1866 for different reasons. They claimed that it took freedoms and rights from qualified whites and gave them to unqualified blacks who were being duped by corrupt carpetbaggers and scalawags. As [[T. Harry Williams]] (who was not a member of the Dunning school) notes, the Dunningites  portrayed the era in stark terms: &lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Reconstruction was a battle between two extremes: the Democrats, as the group which included the vast majority of the whites, standing for decent government and racial supremacy, versus the Republicans, the Negroes, alien carpetbaggers, and renegade scalawags, standing for dishonest government and alien ideals. These historians wrote literally in terms of white and black.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;T. Harry Williams, ''An Analysis of Some Reconstruction Attitudes,&quot; ''Journal of Southern History'' Vol. 12, No. 4 (Nov., 1946), pp. 469–486 [http://www.jstor.org/stable/2197687 in JSTOR] quote at p. 473&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the 1930s, ''revisionism'' became popular among scholars. As disciples of [[Charles A. Beard]], revisionists focused on economics, downplaying politics and constitutional issues. They argued that the Radical rhetoric of equal rights was mostly a smokescreen hiding the true motivation of Reconstruction's real backers. [[Howard K. Beale]] argued that Reconstruction was primarily a successful attempt by financiers, railroad builders and industrialists in the Northeast, using the Republican Party, to control the national government for their own selfish economic ends. Those ends were to continue the wartime high [[protectionism|protective tariff]], the new network of national banks and to guarantee a ''sound'' currency. To succeed, the business class had to remove the old ruling [[agrarian]] class of Southern planters and Midwestern farmers. This it did by inaugurating Reconstruction, which made the South Republican, and by selling its policies to the voters wrapped up in such attractive vote-getting packages as Northern patriotism or the [[bloody shirt]]. Historian William Hesseltine added the point that the Northeastern businessmen wanted to control the South economically, which they did through ownership of the railroads.&lt;ref&gt;Williams 1946 p470&lt;/ref&gt; However, historians in the 1950s and 1960s refuted Beale's economic causation by demonstrating that Northern businessmen were widely divergent on monetary or tariff policy, and seldom paid attention to Reconstruction issues.&lt;ref&gt;Foner 1982; Montgomery, ''vii–ix''&lt;/ref&gt;

The black scholar W. E. B. Du Bois, in his ''Black Reconstruction in America, 1860–1880'', published in 1935, compared results across the states to show achievements by the Reconstruction legislatures and to refute claims about wholesale African-American control of governments. He showed black contributions, as in the establishment of universal public education, charitable and social institutions and universal suffrage as important results, and he noted their collaboration with whites. He also pointed out that whites benefited most by the financial deals made, and he put excesses in the perspective of the war's aftermath. He noted that despite complaints, several states kept their Reconstruction constitutions for nearly a quarter of a century. Despite receiving favorable reviews, his work was largely ignored by white historians.

In the 1960s [[neoabolitionist]] historians emerged, led by [[John Hope Franklin]], [[Kenneth Stampp]] and Eric Foner. Influenced by the [[American Civil Rights Movement (1955–1968)|Civil Rights Movement]], they rejected the Dunning school and found a great deal to praise in Radical Reconstruction. Foner, the primary advocate of this view, argued that it was never truly completed, and that a Second Reconstruction was needed in the late 20th century to complete the goal of full equality for African Americans. The neo-abolitionists followed the revisionists in minimizing the corruption and waste created by Republican state governments, saying it was no worse than [[William M. Tweed|Boss Tweed's]] ring in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, 469; Foner p. ''xxii''&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead, they emphasized that suppression of the rights of African Americans was a worse scandal and a grave corruption of America's republican ideals. They argued that the tragedy of Reconstruction was not that it failed because blacks were incapable of governing, especially as they did not dominate any state government, but that it failed because whites raised an insurgent movement to restore white supremacy. White elite-dominated state legislatures passed disfranchising constitutions from 1890 to 1908 that effectively barred most blacks and many poor whites from voting. This disfranchisement affected millions of people for decades into the 20th century, and closed African Americans and poor whites out of the political process in the South.&lt;ref name=&quot;Glenn Feldman 2004, pp. 135–136&quot;&gt;Glenn Feldman, ''The Disfranchisement Myth: Poor Whites and Suffrage Restriction in Alabama'', Athens: University of Georgia Press, 2004, pp.&amp;nbsp;135–136&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=224731 Richard H. Pildes, &quot;Democracy, Anti-Democracy, and the Canon&quot;, ''Constitutional Commentary'', Vol.17, 2000, p.27]. Retrieved 2008-03-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Re-establishment of white supremacy meant that within a decade white people forgot that blacks were creating thriving middle classes in many states of the South. African Americans' lack of representation meant that they were treated as second-class citizens, with schools and services consistently underfunded in segregated societies, no representation on juries or in law enforcement, and bias in other legislation. It was not until the Civil Rights Movement and the passage of Federal legislation that African Americans regained their suffrage and civil rights in the South, under what is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Second Reconstruction.&quot;

In 1990 [[Eric Foner]] concluded that from the black point of view, &quot;Reconstruction must be judged a failure.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Foner, ''A Short History of Reconstruction'' (1990) p. 255. Foner adds, &quot;What remains certain is that Reconstruction failed, and that for blacks its failure was a disaster whose magnitude cannot be obscured by the accomplishments that endured.&quot; p. 256&lt;/ref&gt; Foner stated Reconstruction was &quot;a noble if flawed experiment, the first attempt to introduce a genuine inter-racial democracy in the United States&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Foner 2009&quot;/&gt; The many factors contributing to the failure included: lack of a permanent federal agency ''specifically'' designed for the enforcement of civil rights; the [[Morrison R. Waite]] Supreme Court decisions that dismantled previous congressional civil rights legislation; and the economic reestablishment of conservative white planters in the South by 1877. Historian [[William McFeely]] explained that although the constitutional amendments and civil rights legislation on their own merit were remarkable achievements, no permanent government agency whose specific purpose was civil rights enforcement had been created.&lt;ref&gt;Although Grant and Attorney General Amos T. Akerman set up a strong legal system to protect African Americans, the Department of Justice did not set up a permanent Civil Rights Division until the [[Civil Rights Act of 1957]]. McFeely (2002), ''Grant: A Biography'', pp. 372–373; 424, 425&lt;/ref&gt;

More recent work by Nina Silber, [[David W. Blight]], Cecelia O'Leary, Laura Edwards, LeeAnn Whites and Edward J. Blum, has encouraged greater attention to race, religion and issues of gender while at the same time pushing the ''end'' of Reconstruction to the end of the 19th century, while monographs by Charles Reagan Wilson, Gaines Foster, W. Scott Poole and Bruce Baker have offered new views of the Southern &quot;[[Lost Cause of the Confederacy|Lost Cause]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce E. Baker, ''What Reconstruction Meant: Historical Memory in the American South'' (2007);  Thomas J. Brown, ed. ''Reconstructions: New Perspectives on the Postbellum United States'' (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

While 1877 is the usual date given for the end of Reconstruction, some historians extend the era to the 1890s.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Orville Vernon Burton, ''The Age of Lincoln'' (2007), p. 312.&lt;/ref&gt;
Reconstruction is unanimously considered a failure, though the reason for this is a matter of controversy.
*The Dunning School considered failure inevitable because they felt that taking the power away from Southern whites was a violation of republicanism.
*A second school sees the reason for failure as Northern Republicans' lack of effectiveness in guaranteeing political rights to blacks.
*A third school blames the failure of not giving land to the freedmen so they could have their own economic base of power.
*A fourth school sees the major reason for failure of reconstruction as the states' inability to suppress the violence of Southern whites when they sought reversal for blacks' gains. Etcheson (2009) points to the &quot;violence that crushed black aspirations and the abandonment by Northern whites of Southern Republicans.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;See Vernon Burton, &quot;Civil War and Reconstruction,&quot; in William L. Barney, ed. ''A Companion to 19th-century America'' (2006) pp 54–56.&lt;/ref&gt; Etcheson wrote that it is hard to see Reconstruction &quot;as concluding in anything but failure.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Nicole Etcheson,  &quot;Reconstruction and the Making of a Free-Labor South,&quot; ''Reviews in American History,'' Volume 37, Number 2, June 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Etcheson adds, &quot;W. E. B. DuBois captured that failure well when he wrote in ''Black Reconstruction in America'' (1935): 'The slave went free; stood a brief moment in the sun; then moved back again toward slavery.'&quot;
* Other historians emphasize the failure to fully incorporate Southern Unionists in the Republican coalition.&lt;ref&gt;Derek W. Frisby points to, &quot;Reconstruction's failure to appreciate the challenges of Southern Unionism and incorporate these loyal Southerners into a strategy that would positively affect the character of the peace.&quot; Frisby, &quot;A Victory Spoiled: West Tennessee Unionists during Reconstruction,&quot; in Paul Cimballa, ed., ''The Great Task Remaining Before Us: Reconstruction as America's Continuing Civil War '' (2010) p 9&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian Donald R. Shaffer maintained that the gains during Reconstruction for [[African Americans]] were not entirely extinguished. The legalization of African American marriage and family and the independence of black churches from white denominations were a source of strength during the [[Jim Crow]] era.  Reconstruction was never forgotten among the black community and remained as a source of inspiration. The system of [[share-cropping]] allowed blacks a considerable amount of freedom over slavery.&lt;ref name=Zuczek_EOTRE_A-L&gt;Zuczek (2006), Encyclopedia of the Reconstruction Era, A-L, pp. 20, 22&lt;/ref&gt;

===In popular culture===
As a journalist writing as Joe Harris for the ''Atlanta Constitution'', mostly after Reconstruction, [[Joel Chandler Harris]] tried to advance racial and sectional reconciliation in the late nineteenth century. He supported the editor [[Henry W. Grady|Henry Grady]]'s vision of a New South, while Grady was editor from 1880 to 1889. Harris wrote many editorials encouraging southern acceptance of the changed conditions and some Northern influence, although he also asserted his belief that it should proceed under white supremacy.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} 

In popular literature two early 20th-century novels by [[Thomas Dixon, Jr.|Thomas Dixon]]—''[[The Clansman]]'' (1905) and ''[[The Leopard's Spots|The Leopard's Spots: A Romance of the White Man's Burden – 1865–1900]]'' (1902)— romanticized white resistance to Northern/black coercion, hailing vigilante action by the KKK. Dixon's ''The Clansmen'' was adapted for the screen in [[D.W. Griffith]]'s anti-Republican movie ''[[The Birth of a Nation]]'' (1915), considered to contribute to the 20th-century revival of the [[KKK]]. Many other authors romanticized the benevolence of slavery and the elite world of the antebellum plantations in memoirs and histories published in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, and the [[United Daughters of the Confederacy]] promoted influential works by women in these genres.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gardner&quot;&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=-xG7Dfsxya8C&amp;dq=Sara+Pryor&amp;q=Sara+Rice+Pryor#v=onepage&amp;q=Sara%20Pryor&amp;f=false Sarah E.

'''Bo Hansson''' (April 10, 1943 &amp;ndash; April 23, 2010)&lt;ref&gt;{{sv icon}} [http://www.dn.se/kultur-noje/musik/musikern-bo-hansson-har-avlidit-1.1084033 Musikern Bo Hansson har avlidit]. ''Dagens Nyheter''. Retrieved 2010-04-27. &quot;He was found [dead] Saturday afternoon in his home [...] in Stockholm.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Swedish people|Swedish]] [[musician]] best known for his four instrumental albums released in the 1970s.

==Early life and musical career==
He spent his early life in a remote village in the pine forests of northern Sweden, but a change in his parents' fortunes forced a move to [[Stockholm]] and they were forced to leave the young Hansson behind, in the care of family friends. As a teenager he joined his parents in Stockholm, where he soon became interested in the burgeoning rock and roll scene and taught himself to play the guitar, before joining the band, Rock-Olga.

After the rock and roll craze gave way to jazz and blues in the late fifties, he joined 'Slim' Notini's Blues Gang as a [[guitar]]ist. Hansson was able to move on and form his own blues group The Merrymen, who supported [[The Rolling Stones]] on an early Scandinavian tour.

In 1966, Hansson saw American [[jazz]] organist [[Jack McDuff]] perform at Stockholm's Gyllene Cirkeln Club, and was so captivated by the performance that he decided to leave The Merrymen to expand his musical horizons. Encouraged by fellow Merryman Bill Öhrström, he eventually acquired his own [[Hammond organ]]. Öhrström became an [[A&amp;R]] man and producer at [[Polydor]] Sweden, and introduced Hansson to other musicians, one of whom was drummer Janne Carlsson. Hansson and Carlsson immediately hit it off and were signed by Polydor under the band name [[Hansson &amp; Karlsson]], playing up-tempo Hammond organ based music and releasing three albums between 1967 and 1969. They became immensely popular in their home country and some parts of Europe, and even reached the ear of [[Jimi Hendrix]], who took time out from his tour to jam with the duo, along with [[George Clemons]] on drums and [[Georg Wadenius]] on guitar, at the Klub Filips in Stockholm in late 1967. Hendrix went on to record a Hansson song, &quot;Tax Free&quot;.

==Solo debut==
By 1969, Janne Carlsson had become a successful [[comedian]] and TV host, and Hansson decide to break up the partnership. Entranced by a copy of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', which he had purloined from his girlfriend, he moved into a friend's vacant apartment and started writing. When the unfortunate friend returned, he found that he had been evicted from his apartment after numerous complaints about the noise Hansson was creating. Hansson retreated to a remote cottage on an island off Stockholm where he, drummer Rune Carlsson and engineer Anders Lind, who had worked previously with Hansson &amp; Karlsson, spent the winter of 1969 recording what was to become Hansson's debut solo album on a borrowed four track recorder. The resourceful Lind was even able to gain use of the only eight track recorder in Sweden at that time at the [[Sveriges Radio|Swedish National Radio]] station, on the pretext that he was interested in buying one himself and wanted to test it. Once there, he persuaded [[session musician]]s Gunnar Bergsten and Sten Bergman to flesh out the recordings.

''Sagan Om Ringen'' was released on [[Silence Records]] (Sweden's first independent record label which was set up by Anders Lind) in autumn 1970 and became a huge hit. Copies of the album began to filter across to Britain where it came to the attention of [[Tony Stratton-Smith]], who was so impressed that he released the album as ''[[Music Inspired by Lord of the Rings (Bo Hansson album)|Music Inspired by Lord of the Rings]]'' on his own [[Charisma Records|Famous Charisma]] label in September 1972. The album peaked at #34 on the [[UK Album Chart]] and became Bo's only UK Top 40 album.

==Further musical career==
Encouraged by the success of his first album, Hansson was booked into Stockholm's Studio Decibel where he began work on the follow-up. Using the same team, along with guitarist Kenny Håkansson, the new recordings benefitted from the superior equipment and ''Ur Trollkarlens Hatt'' was released on Silence Records in late 1972, and on Charisma in the UK as ''Magician's Hat'' in October 1973. Although critically acclaimed, it failed to reach the popularity of the earlier work, and did not chart in the UK.

Popularity in Sweden, however, put pressure on Hansson to tour, and a hastily put-together touring band was assembled, however, the tour was cancelled by the reclusive keyboard player, citing a lack of motivation. Instead, he returned to Studio Decibel and started work on his third album. Using the tried and trusted backing musicians the recordings continued the progression of the previous album, and ''Mellanväsen'' was issued on Silence Records in October 1975, and as ''Attic Thoughts'' on Charisma in the UK in February 1976. Despite being the most accomplished record of Hansson's career, it did not find the success it deserved, though it did feature a song called ''Rabbit Music'' which would point the way to Hansson's next album.

In 1976, Hansson and Silence Records parted company, and he was able to negotiate a worldwide deal with The Famous Charisma Label. He returned once again to Studio Decibel and began work on recordings that were inspired by another book; [[Richard Adams]]' ''[[Watership Down]]''. Using the same session musicians but with a new producer, Pontus Olssen, the recordings were issued in September 1977 as ''El 'Ahrairah'' (after the novel's rabbit god) and ''Music Inspired by Watership Down'' on Charisma in the UK, and on [[Sire Records]] in the US. Another disappointing chart performance led to Hansson's withdrawal from the popular music scene, and though he worked on a number of projects with friends, little was heard from him until 1985 when he released the Swedish issue only album ''Mitt I Livet'' (In the Middle of Life) on Silence Records (SRS 4700). He then again dropped off the radar.

==Later years==
Hansson found a new following amongst Swedish DJs in recent years, who sampled his music - something which apparently pleased him enormously. Although the better known ''Music Inspired by Lord of the Rings'' made it onto CD in 1988, in a remixed version accompanied by selected tracks from ''Magician's Hat'' and ''Attic Thoughts'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Bo-Hansson-Lord-Of-The-Rings/release/349094 |title=Bo Hansson - Lord of the Rings (CD) at Discogs |publisher=Discogs.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; his other 1970s albums remained unavailable in full until 2005 when Silence Records (through [[EMI]]) re-issued them on CD, digitally re-mastered and with previously unreleased extra material.
In 1998 Hansson &amp; Karlsson reunited for some live concerts and a compilation album.

Due to his pioneering work and the mysteries surrounding Hansson &amp; Karlsson's rise and fall, Hansson received the status of a living legend among the independent musical community in Sweden. He occasionally performed live sets with fellow organist [[Eric Malmberg]] who has been greatly inspired by Hansson's work.

Bo Hansson died in Stockholm on 23 April 2010.

'''Capparales''' is a [[botanical name]] of an [[order (biology)|order]] of [[flowering plant]]s. It was used in the [[Cronquist system]] for an order in subclass [[Dilleniidae]] and in the [[Kubitzki system]], nowadays. In the 1981 version of this system it included :

* order Capparales
*: family [[Tovariaceae]]
*: family [[Capparaceae]]
*: family [[Brassicaceae]]
*: family [[Moringaceae]]
*: family [[Resedaceae]]

The [[APG II system]] includes all the plants involved in the (expanded) order [[Brassicales]]. For names above the [[rank (botany)|rank]] of family the principle of priority is not obligatory, hence the difference between the two names.

'''Nepenthales''' is a [[botanical name]] for an order of [[flowering plants]]. The name was used by the [[Cronquist system]] for an order in subclass [[Dilleniidae]], which in the 1981 version of this system included: 

* order Nepenthales
*: family [[Droseraceae]]
*: family [[Nepenthaceae]]
*: family [[Sarraceniaceae]]

The [[APG II system]] assigns this last family to the order [[Ericales]] and the first two to the order [[Caryophyllales]]. This is counter to what would be expected from the method of catching insects.  Here, the Droseraceae stand apart, the [[sundew]]s catching [[insect]]s with adhesive droplets and the [[Venus Flytrap]] capturing them in leaves with interlocking teeth.  The other two families include [[pitcher plant]]s, which drown their prey.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''China proper''' (also '''Inner China''') or '''Eighteen Provinces'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/china/cn_glos.html|title=Glossary -- China. Library of Congress Country Studies|publisher=[[Library of Congress]]|quote=Used broadly to mean China within the Great Wall, with its eighteen historic provinces. Divisible into two major, sharply contrasting regions, north China and south China. The dependencies on the north and west--Manchuria (now usually referred to as northeast China), Mongolia, Xizang (Tibet), and Xinjiang or Chinese Turkestan--were known in the imperial era as Outer China.}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a term used by Western writers on the [[Qing Dynasty]] to express a distinction between the core and frontier regions of China. There is no fixed extent for China proper, as many administrative, cultural, and linguistic shifts have occurred in Chinese history. One definition refers to the original area of Chinese civilization, the [[Central Plain (China)|North China Plain]]; another to the &quot;Eighteen Provinces&quot; system of the [[Ming Dynasty]].

But in China, most people don't know what is &quot;China proper&quot;.

== Origin of the concept ==
It is not clear when the concept of &quot;China proper&quot; in the [[Western world]] appeared. According to [[Harry Harding (political scientist)|Harry Harding]], it can date back to 1827.&lt;ref&gt;[[Harry Harding (political scientist)|Harding, Harry]] (1993). &quot;The Concept of 'Greater China': Themes, Variations, and Reservations&quot;, in ''The China Quarterly'', 1993, pp.&amp;nbsp;660–686.&lt;/ref&gt;  But as early as in 1795, [[William Winterbotham]] adopted this concept in his book. When describing the Chinese Empire under the [[Qing Dynasty]], Winterbotham divided it into three parts: China proper, Chinese [[Tartary]], and the [[List of tributaries of Imperial China|States Tributary to China]]. He adopted the opinions of [[Jean-Baptiste Du Halde|Du Halde]] and [[Jean-Baptiste Grosier|Grosier]] and suspected that the name of &quot;China&quot; came from [[Qin Dynasty]].  He then said: &quot;China, properly so called,... comprehends from north to south eighteen degrees; its extent from east to west being somewhat less...&quot; &lt;ref&gt;[[William Winterbotham|Winterbotham, William]] (1795). ''An Historical, Geographical, and Philosophical View of the Chinese Empire...'', London: Printed for, and sold by the editor; J. Ridgway; and W. Button. (pp.&amp;nbsp;35–37: General Description of the Chinese Empire → '''China Proper'''→ 1. Origin of its Name, 2. Extent, Boundaries, &amp;c.)&lt;/ref&gt;

However, to introduce China proper, Winterbotham still used the outdated 15-province system of the Ming Dynasty, which the Qing Dynasty used until 1662. Although [[Ming Dynasty]] also had 15 basic local divisions, Winterbotham uses the name of Kiang-nan (江南, Jiāngnán) province, which had been called Nan-Zhili (南直隶, Nán-Zhílì) in Ming Dynasty and was renamed to Kiang-nan (i.e., Jiangnan) in 1645, the second year after the [[Qing Dynasty]] overthrew the [[Ming Dynasty]]. This 15-province system was gradually replaced by the 18-province system between 1662 to 1667.  Using the 15-province system and the name of Kiang-nan Province indicates that the concept of China proper probably had appeared between 1645 and 1662 and this concept may reflect the idea that identifies China as the territory of the former Ming Dynasty after the [[Fall of the Ming Dynasty|Manchu conquest of Ming]].

The concept of &quot;China proper&quot; also appeared before this 1795 book.  It can be found in ''The Gentleman's Magazine'', published in 1790, and ''The Monthly Review'', published in 1749.&lt;ref&gt;Copyright has passed, &quot;Full View&quot; available through [[Google Books]].&lt;/ref&gt; In the nineteenth century, the term &quot;China proper&quot; was sometimes used by Chinese officials when they were communicating in foreign languages. For instance, the Qing ambassador to Britain [[Zeng Jize]] used it in an English language article, which he published in 1887.&lt;ref&gt;Marquis Tseng, &quot;China: The Sleep and the Awakening&quot;, ''The Asiatic Quarterly Review'', Vol. III 3 (1887), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
Today, China proper is a controversial concept in China itself, since the current official paradigm does not contrast the core and the periphery of China. There is no single widely used term corresponding to it in the [[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin language]].

In the People's Republic of China (PRC), the official policy is that [[Taiwan]] and Tibet are integral parts of China, and claims that these regions always have been. The concept of China proper is avoided since it may be used to justify [[separatism]]. On the other hand, proponents of [[Taiwanese people|Taiwanese]], [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]], and other ethnic separatism would support such a distinction, as they want to make clear the difference between the concept of &quot;China proper&quot;, a culturally-based nation, and the &quot;People's Republic of China&quot;, a political entity.  In this view, China proper is regarded as &quot;China&quot;, and other regions are regarded as [[Imperial era of Chinese history|colonial acquisitions of China]].

== Extent ==
[[Image:Ming foreign relations 1580.jpg|thumb|250px|The approximate extent of China proper during the late [[Ming Dynasty]], the last Han Chinese dynasty.]]
[[Image:China Proper.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Eighteen Provinces of China proper in 1875, before Taiwan's separation from Fujian in 1885 and its annexation by Japan in 1895.]]
There is no fixed extent for China proper, as it is used to express the contrast between the core and frontier regions of China from multiple perspectives: historical, administrative, cultural, and linguistic.

=== Historical perspective ===

One way of thinking about China proper is to refer to ancient [[Han Chinese]] [[dynasties]]. Chinese civilization developed from a core region in the [[Central Plain (China)|North China Plain]], and expanded outwards over several millennia, conquering and assimilating surrounding peoples, or being conquered and influenced in turn. Some dynasties, such as the [[Han Dynasty|Han]] and [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]] dynasties, were particularly expansionist, extending far into Central Asia, while others, such as the [[Jin Dynasty (265-420)|Jin]] and [[Song Dynasty|Song]] dynasties, were forced to relinquish the North China Plain itself to rivals from Northeastern and Central Asia.

The [[Ming Dynasty]] was the last [[Han Chinese]] dynasty and second-last imperial dynasty to rule China. It governed fifteen administrative entities, which included thirteen provinces ([[Chinese character|Chinese]]: 布政使司; [[Pinyin]]: Bùzhèngshǐ Sī) and two &quot;directly-governed&quot; areas. After the [[Manchu people|Manchu]]-founded [[Qing Dynasty]] conquered the Ming Dynasty, the Qing court decided to continue to use the Ming administrative system to rule over former Ming lands, without applying it to other domains within the [[Qing Dynasty]], namely Manchuria, Mongolia, Xinjiang, and Tibet. The 15 administrative units of the [[Ming Dynasty]] underwent minor reforms to become the '''Eighteen Provinces''' (一十八行省 Pinyin: ''Yīshíbā Xíngshěng'', or 十八省 ''Shíbā Shěng'') of China proper under the Qing Dynasty. It was these eighteen provinces that early Western sources referred to as China proper. 

There are some minor differences between the extent of Ming China and the extent of the eighteen provinces of Qing China: for example, some parts of Manchuria were a Ming possession belonging to the Ming province of Liaodong (now [[Liaoning]]); however, the Qing conquered it before the rest of China and did not put the region back into the provinces of China proper. On the other hand, Taiwan was a new acquisition of the [[Qing Dynasty]], and it was put into [[Fujian]], one of the provinces of China proper. Eastern [[Kham]] in Greater Tibet was added to [[Sichuan]], while much of what now constitutes northern [[Burma]] was added to [[Yunnan]].

Near the end of the Qing Dynasty, there was an effort to extend the province system of China proper to the rest of the empire. Taiwan was made into a separate province in 1885; however it was ceded to Japan in 1895. [[Xinjiang]] was reorganized into a province in 1884. Manchuria was split into the three provinces of [[Fengtian]], [[Jilin]] and [[Heilongjiang]] in 1907. There was discussion to do the same in Tibet, [[Qinghai|Kokonor]], Inner Mongolia, and Outer Mongolia, but these proposals were not put to practice, and these areas were outside the province system of China proper when the Qing Dynasty fell in 1912.

The Provinces of the Qing Dynasty were:

|}

Some of the revolutionaries who sought to overthrow Qing rule desired to establish a state independent of the Qing Dynasty within the bounds of the Eighteen Provinces, as evinced by the Eighteen-Star Flag they used. Others favoured the replacement of the entire Qing Dynasty by a new republic, as evinced by the Five-Striped Flag they used. Some revolutionaries, such as [[Zou Rong]], used the term ''Zhongguo Benbu'' (中国本部) which roughly identifies the Eighteen Provinces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Revolutionary Army |last=Zou |first=Rong |authorlink=Zou Rong |coauthors= |year=1903 |publisher= |chapter   = Chapter 4|location= |isbn= |page= |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the Qing Dynasty fell, the abdication decree of the Qing Emperor bequeathed the entire Empire to the newborn [[Republic of China]], and the latter idea was therefore adopted by the new republic as the principle of [[Five Races Under One Union]], with Five Races referring to the Han Chinese, Manchus, Mongols, Muslims (Uyghurs, Hui etc.) and Tibetans. The Five-Striped Flag was adopted as the national flag, and the Republic of China viewed itself as a single state encompassing all five regions handed down by the Qing Dynasty. The People's Republic of China, which was founded in 1949 and replaced the Republic of China on the mainland, has continued to claim essentially the same borders, with the only major exception being the recognition of independent [[Mongolia]]. As a result, the concept of China proper fell out of favour in China.

The Eighteen Provinces of the Qing Dynasty still exist, but their boundaries have changed. [[Beijing]] and [[Tianjin]] were eventually split from Hebei (renamed from Zhili), [[Shanghai]] from Jiangsu, [[Chongqing]] from [[Sichuan]], [[Ningxia]] autonomous region from [[Gansu]], and [[Hainan]] from Guangdong. Guangxi is now an [[autonomous region of China|autonomous region]]. The provinces that the late Qing Dynasty set up have also been kept: [[Xinjiang]] became an autonomous region under the People's Republic of China, while the three provinces of Manchuria now have somewhat different borders, with Fengtian renamed as Liaoning. 

When the Qing Dynasty fell, Republican Chinese control of Qing territory, including of those generally considered to be in &quot;China proper&quot;, was tenuous, and practically nonexistent in [[Tibet (1912–1951)|Tibet]] and [[Mongolian People's Republic|Outer Mongolia]] (since 1922), which were controlled by governments that declared independence. The Republic of China subdivided Inner Mongolia in its time on the mainland, although the People's Republic of China later joined Mongol-inhabited territory into a single autonomous region. The PRC joined the [[Qamdo Prefecture|Qamdo area]] into the Tibet area (later the [[Tibet Autonomous Region]]). [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Nationalist China]] was forced to acknowledge the independence of Mongolia (former Outer Mongolia) and [[Tannu Uriankhai]] (now part of Russia as [[Tyva Republic|The Tyva Republic]]), in 1945.

=== Ethnic perspective ===
China proper is often associated with the [[Han Chinese]], the majority ethnic group of China and with the extent of the [[Chinese language]](s), an important unifying element of the Han Chinese ethnicity.

However, Han Chinese areas today do not correspond well to the Eighteen Provinces of the Qing Dynasty. Much of southwestern China, such as areas in the provinces of [[Yunnan]], [[Guangxi]], and [[Guizhou]], was part of successive Han Chinese dynasties, including the Ming Dynasty and the Eighteen Provinces of the Qing Dynasty. However, these areas were and continue to be populated by various non-Han Chinese minority groups, such as the [[Zhuang people|Zhuang]], the [[Miao people]], and the [[Bouyei]]. Conversely, Han Chinese are the majority in most of Manchuria, much of Inner Mongolia, many areas in Xinjiang and scattered parts of Tibet, not least due to the expansion of Han Chinese settlement encouraged by the late Qing Dynasty, the Republic of China, and the People's Republic of China.

Ethnic Han Chinese is not synonymous with speakers of the [[Chinese language]]. Many non-Han Chinese ethnicities, such as the [[Hui people|Hui]] and [[Manchu people|Manchu]], are essentially monolingual in Chinese, but do not identify as Han Chinese. The Chinese language itself is also a complex entity, and should be described as a family of related languages rather than a single language if the criterion of [[mutual intelligibility]] is used to classify its subdivisions.

In polls a slim majority of the people of Taiwan call themselves &quot;Taiwanese&quot; only with the rest identifying as &quot;Taiwanese and Chinese&quot; or &quot;Chinese&quot; only.  98% are descendants of immigrants from China since the 1600s, a large number of which also have aboriginal ancestry, but the inclusion of Taiwan in Greater China, or let alone from China proper, is still a controversial subject. See [[History of Taiwan]] for more information.

'''Inner Mongolia''' ([[Mongolian language|Mongolian]]: &lt;small&gt;[[Mongolian script|s]]&lt;/small&gt; [[Image:Oburmonggul.svg|35px|]], ''Öbür Monggol'' and &lt;small&gt;[[Mongolian Cyrillic alphabet|c]]&lt;/small&gt; {{linktext|Өвөр}} {{linktext|Монгол}}, ''Övör Mongol''; {{zh|s={{linktext|内蒙古}}|p=Nèi Měnggǔ}}, but officially romanized to '''Nei Mongol''') is an [[Autonomous regions of the People's Republic of China|autonomous region]] of the [[China|People's Republic of China]], located in the northern region of the country. Inner Mongolia shares an international border with [[Mongolia]] and [[Russia]]. Its capital is [[Hohhot]]. Other major cities include [[Baotou]], [[Chifeng]], and [[Ordos City|Ordos]].

The Autonomous Region was established in 1947 on the area of former [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] provinces of [[Suiyuan]], [[Chahar Province|Chahar]], [[Rehe Province|Rehe]], [[Liaobei Province|Liaobei]] and [[Xing'an]] along with the northern parts of [[Gansu]] and [[Ningxia]].
It is the third-largest subdivision of China spanning about 1,200,000&amp;nbsp;km² (463,000 sq mi) or 12% of China's total land area. It has a population of about 24 million as of 2004.
The majority of the population in the region are [[Han Chinese]], with a substantial [[Mongols in China|Mongol]] minority. The official languages are [[Chinese language|Chinese]] and [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]], the latter written in the [[Mongolian script]], as opposed to the [[Mongolian Cyrillic alphabet]] used in the state of Mongolia.

==Name==
In Chinese, the region is known as &quot;Inner Mongolia&quot;, where the terms of &quot;Inner/Outer&quot; are derived from [[Manchu language|Manchu]] ''dorgi''/''tulergi'' (cf. [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]] ''dotugadu''/''gadagadu''). Inner Mongolia is distinct from [[Outer Mongolia]], which was a term used by the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] and previous governments to refer to what is now the independent [[sovereign state|state]] of [[Mongolia]] plus the Republic of [[Tuva]] in [[Russia]]. In [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]], the region was called ''Dotugadu monggol'' during [[Mongolia during Qing rule|Qing rule]] and was renamed into ''Öbür Monggol'' in 1947, ''öbür'' meaning the southern side of a mountain, while the Chinese term ''nei menggu'' was retained. Some Mongolians use the name &quot;Southern Mongolia&quot; in [[English language|English]] as well.&lt;ref&gt;Huhbator Borjigin. 2004.

==History==
{{See also|History of Mongolia}}
Much of what is known about the history of Greater Mongolia, including Inner Mongolia, is known through Chinese chronicles and historians. Before the rise of the Mongols in the 13th century, what is now central and western Inner Mongolia, especially the [[Hetao]] region, alternated in control between [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] agriculturalists in the south and [[Xiongnu]], [[Xianbei]], [[Khitan people|Khitan]], [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]], [[Tujue]], and other [[Mongol]] nomads of the north. The historical narrative of what is now Eastern Inner Mongolia mostly consists of alternations between different [[Tungustic]] and [[Mongol]] tribes, rather than the struggle between nomads and Chinese agriculturalists.

===Early History===
During the [[Zhou Dynasty]], central and western Inner Mongolia (the Hetao region and surrounding areas) were inhabited by nomadic peoples such as the [[Loufan]], Linhu, and [[Beidi|Dí]], while eastern Inner Mongolia was inhabited by the [[Donghu people|Donghu]]. During the [[Warring States Period]], [[King Wuling of Zhao|King Wuling]] (340–295 BC) of the [[state of Zhao]] based in what is now [[Hebei]] and [[Shanxi]] provinces pursued an expansionist policy towards the region. After destroying the [[Beidi|Dí]] [[state of Zhongshan]] in what is now Hebei province, he defeated the Linhu and [[Loufan]] and created the [[Datong|commandery of Yunzhong]] near modern [[Hohhot]]. King Wuling of Zhao also built a long wall stretching through the Hetao region. After [[Qin Shihuang]] created the first unified Chinese empire in 221 BC, he sent the general [[Meng Tian]] to [[Qin's campaign against the Xiongnu|drive the Xiongnu from the region]], and incorporated the old Zhao wall into the Qin Dynasty Great Wall of China. He also maintained two commanderies in the region: [[Commandery of Jiuyuan|Jiuyuan]] and Yunzhong, and moved 30,000 households there to solidify the region. After the Qin Dynasty collapsed in 206 BC, these efforts were abandoned.

During the [[Western Han Dynasty]], [[Emperor Wu of Han|Emperor Wu]] sent the general [[Wei Qing]] to [[Han–Xiongnu War|reconquer the Hetao region from the Xiongnu]] in 127 BC. After the conquest, Emperor Wu continued the policy of building settlements in Hetao to defend against the Xiong-Nu. In that same year he established the commanderies of [[commandery of Shuofang|Shuofang]] and [[commandery of Wuyuan|Wuyuan]] in Hetao. At the same time, what is now eastern Inner Mongolia was controlled by the [[Xianbei]], who would later on eclipse the Xiongnu in power and influence.

During the [[Eastern Han Dynasty]] (25–220 AD), Xiongnu who surrendered to the Han Dynasty began to be settled in Hetao, and intermingled with the Han immigrants in the area. Later on during the [[Western Jin Dynasty]], it was a Xiongnu noble from Hetao, [[Liu Yuan (Han Zhao)|Liu Yuan]], who established the [[Han Zhao]] kingdom in the region, thereby beginning the [[Sixteen Kingdoms]] period that saw the disintegration of northern China under a variety of Han and non-Han (including Xiongnu and Xianbei) regimes.

The [[Sui Dynasty]] (581–618) and [[Tang Dynasty]] (618–907) re-established a unified Chinese empire, and like their predecessors they conquered and settled people into Hetao, though once again these efforts were aborted when the Tang empire began to collapse. Hetao (along with the rest of what now consists Inner Mongolia) was then taken over by the [[Khitan Empire]] (Liao Dynasty), founded by the Khitans, a nomadic people originally from what is now the southern part of Manchuria and eastern Inner Mongolia. They were followed by the [[Western Xia]] of the [[Tangut people|Tangut]]s, who took control of what is now the western part of Inner Mongolia (including western Hetao) . The Khitans were later replaced by the [[Jurchens]], precursors to the modern [[Manchus]], who established the [[Jin Dynasty (1115–1234)|Jin Dynasty]] over Manchuria and northern China.

===Mongol Period===
After [[Genghis Khan]] unified the Mongol tribes in 1206 and founded the [[Mongol Empire]], the [[Tanguts|Tangut]] [[Western Xia]] empire was ultimately conquered in 1227, and the [[Jurchens|Jurchen]] [[Jin Dynasty (1115–1234)|Jin Dynasty]] fell in 1234. In 1271, Genghis Khan's grandson [[Khubilai Khan|Khubilai]] established the [[Yuan Dynasty]]. Khubilai's summer capital [[Shangdu]] (aka Xanadu) was located near present-day [[Duolun County|Dolonnor]]. During that time [[Ongud]] and [[Khunggirad]] peoples dominated the area of what is now Inner Mongolia. After the Yuan Dynasty was evicted by the Han-led [[Ming Dynasty]] in 1368, the Ming rebuilt the [[Great Wall of China]] at its present location, which roughly follows the southern border of the modern Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region (though it deviates significantly at the Hebei-Inner Mongolia border). The Ming established the Three Guards composed of the Mongols there. Soon after the [[Tumu incident]] in 1449, when the Oirat ruler [[Esen Taishi]] captured the Chinese emperor, Mongols flooded south from Northern Mongolia to Southern Mongolia. Thus from then on until 1635, Inner Mongolia was the political and cultural center of the Mongols during the [[Northern Yuan Dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;CPAtwood-Encyclopedia of Mongolia and the Mongol Empire, p.246&lt;/ref&gt;

===Qing Period===
The eastern Mongol tribes near and in Manchuria, particularly the [[Khorchin]] and Southern [[Khalkha]] in today`s Inner Mongolia intermarried, formed alliances with, and fought against the [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]] tribes until [[Nurhaci]], the founder of the new Jin Dynasty, consolidated his control over all groups in the area in 1593.&lt;ref&gt;Atwood, Christopher. Encyclopedia of Mongolia and the Mongol Empire, p.449&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Manchus]] gained far-reaching control of the Inner Mongolian tribes in 1635, when [[Ligden Khan]]'s son surrendered the [[Chahar Mongols|Chakhar]] Mongol tribes to the [[Manchus]]. The Manchus subsequently invaded Ming China in 1644, bringing it under the control of their newly established [[Qing Dynasty]]. Under the Qing Dynasty (1636–1912), [[Mongolian plateau|Greater Mongolia]] was [[Mongolia during Qing rule|administered]] in a different way for each region:

* &quot;Outer Mongolia&quot;: This region corresponds to the modern state of [[Mongolia]], plus the Russian-administered region of [[Tannu Uriankhai]], and a part of northern [[Xinjiang]]. It included the four leagues (''aimag'') of the [[Khalkha Mongols]] north of the [[Gobi desert|Gobi]], as well as the [[Tannu Uriankhai]] and [[Khovd Province|Khovd]] regions in northwestern Mongolia, which were overseen by the [[General of Uliastai]] from the city of [[Uliastai]].
* &quot;Inner Mongolia&quot;: This region corresponded to most of modern Inner Mongolia and some neighbouring areas in [[Liaoning]] and [[Jilin]] provinces. The [[banner (Inner Mongolia)|banners]] and tribes in this region came under six [[league (Inner Mongolia)|leagues]] (''chuulghan''): [[Tongliao|Jirim]], [[Juuuda]], [[Josutu]], [[Xilingol]], [[Ulanqab]], and [[Yekejuu]].
* &quot;Taoxi Mongolia&quot;: The [[Alashan Öölüd]] and [[Ejine Torghuud]] banners were separate from the aimags of Outer Mongolia and the chuulghans of Inner Mongolia. This territory is equivalent to modern-day [[Alxa League]], the westernmost part of what is now Inner Mongolia.
* The Chahar [[Eight Banners]] were controlled by the military commander of Chahar (now [[Zhangjiakou]]). Their extent corresponded to southern Ulanqab and [[Bayannur]] in modern Inner Mongolia, plus the region around [[Zhangjiakou]] in [[Hebei]] province. At the same time, the jurisdiction of some border departments of [[Zhili]] and [[Shanxi]] provinces also belonged to this region.
* The [[Guihua Tümed]] banner was controlled by the military commander of Suiyuan (now [[Hohhot]]). This corresponds to the vicinities of the modern city of [[Hohhot]]. At the same time, the jurisdiction of some border departments of modern [[Shanxi]] province also belonged to this region.
* The [[Hulunbuir]] region in what is now northeastern Inner Mongolia was part of the jurisdiction of the General of [[Heilongjiang]], one of the three generals of [[Manchuria]].

Ordinary Mongols were not allowed to travel outside their own leagues. During the eighteenth century, growing numbers of [[Han Chinese]] settlers had illegally begun to move into the Inner Mongolian steppe. By 1791 there had been so many Han Chinese settlers in the [[Qian Gorlos Mongol Autonomous County|Front Gorlos Banner]] that the jasak had petitioned the Qing government to legalize the status of the peasants who had already settled there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Cambridge History of China |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |volume=10 |year=1978 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location= |isbn= |page=356 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the nineteenth century, the Manchus were becoming increasingly sinicized, and faced with the Russian threat, they began to encourage Han Chinese farmers to settle in both Mongolia and Manchuria. This policy was followed by subsequent governments. The railroads that were being built in these regions were especially useful to the Han Chinese settlers. Land was either sold by Mongol Princes, or leased to Han Chinese farmers, or simply taken away from the nomads and given to Han Chinese farmers.

===Republic of China period===
Outer Mongolia regained independence from the Qing Dynasty in 1911, when the Jebtsundamba Khutugtu of the Khalkha was declared the Bogd Khan of Mongolia. Although almost all banners of Inner Mongolia recognized the Bogd Khan as the supreme ruler of Mongols, the internal strife within the region prevented a full reunification. The Mongol rebellions in Inner Mongolia were counterbalanced by princes who hoped to see a restored Qing dynasty in Manchuria and Mongolia, as they considered the theocratic rule of the Bogd Khan would be against their modernizing objectives for Mongolia.&lt;ref&gt;Atwood, Christopher. The Encyclopedia of Mongolia and the Mongol Empire, p.454&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, the newly formed Republic of China promised a new nation of five races (Chinese, Manchu, Mongol, Tibetan and Muslim),&lt;ref&gt;Atwood, Christopher. The Encyclopedia of Mongolia and the Mongol Empire, p.91&lt;/ref&gt; and suppressed the Mongol rebellions in the area,&lt;ref&gt;Belov, E.A. Anti-Chinese rebellion led by Babujav in Inner Mongolia, 1915-1916. - Annaly (Moscow), no. 2, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Belov, E.A. Rossiya i Mongoliya (1911–1919). Moscow: Vost. Lit.Publ.&lt;/ref&gt; forcing the Inner Mongolian princes to recognize the Republic of China. 

The Republic of China reorganized Inner Mongolia into provinces:
* [[Rehe (province)|Rehe]] province was created to include the Juuuda and Josutu leagues, plus the [[Chengde]] area in what is now northern [[Hebei]].
* [[Chahar (province)|Chahar]] province was created to include Xilingol league as well as much of the former territory of the Eight Banners.
* [[Suiyuan]] province was created to include Ulanqab league, Yekejuu league, and the Hetao region (former Guihua Tümed territory).
* Hulunbuir stayed within [[Heilongjiang]] in Manchuria, which had become a province.
* Most of Jirim league came under the new province of [[Liaoning|Fengtian]] in southern Manchuria.
* Taoxi Mongolia, i.e. Alashan and Ejine leagues, was incorporated into neighbouring [[Gansu]] province. Later on [[Ningxia]] province was split out of northern Gansu, and Taoxi Mongolia became part of Ningxia.

Some [[Republic of China]] maps still show this structure.

===Mengjiang period===

[[Mengjiang]] was an autonomous area of [[Reorganized National Government of China]], which was a puppet regime of Japan.

In  1931 Manchuria came under the control of the Japanese puppet state [[Manchukuo]], taking the Mongol areas in the Manchurian provinces (i.e. Hulunbuir and Jirim leagues) along. Rehe was also incorporated into Manchukuo in 1933, taking Juu Uda and Josutu leagues along with it. These areas were administered by Manchukuo until the end of [[World War II]] in 1945.

In 1937, open war broke out between the [[Republic of China]] and the [[Empire of Japan]]. On December 8, 1937, Mongolian Prince [[De Wang]] declared the independence of the remaining parts of Inner Mongolia (i.e. the Suiyuan and Chahar provinces) as [[Mengjiang|Mengkiang]] or Mengkukuo, and signed close agreements with Manchukuo and Japan. The capital was established at [[Zhangbei Town|Zhangbei]] (now in [[Hebei]] province), with the puppet government's control extending as far west as the [[Hohhot]] region. In August 1945, Mengkiang was taken by Soviet and Outer Mongolian troops during [[Manchurian Strategic Offensive Operation]]. Despite a considerable movement among Inner Mongolia's Mongols(who comprised then around 15% of Inner Mongolia's population, while Han Chinese around 83%) for unification with Outer Mongolia, Inner Mongolia remained part of China.

===Communist era===
The Communist movement gradually gained momentum as part of the Third Communist International in Inner Mongolia during the Japanese period. By the end of WWII, the Inner Mongolian faction of the ComIntern had a functional militia, and actively opposed the attempts at independence by De Wang's Chinggisid princes on the grounds of fighting feudalism. Following the end of [[World War II]], the [[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communists]] gained control of Manchuria as well as the Inner Mongolian Communists with decisive Soviet support, and established the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in 1947. The Comintern army was absorbed into the People's Liberation Army. Initially the autonomous region included just the Hulunbuir region. Over the next decade, as the communists established the [[People's Republic of China]] and consolidated control over mainland China, Inner Mongolia was expanded westwards to include five of the six original leagues (except Josutu League, which remains in [[Liaoning]] province), the northern part of the Chahar region, by then a league as well (southern Chahar remains in [[Hebei]] province), the Hetao region, and the Alashan and Ejine banners. Eventually, near all areas with sizeable Mongol populations were incorporated into the region, giving present-day Inner Mongolia its elongated shape. The leader of Inner Mongolia during that time, as both regional CPC secretary and head of regional government, was [[Ulanhu]].

During the [[Cultural Revolution]], the administration of Ulanhu was purged, and a wave of repressions was initiated against the Mongol population of the autonomous region.&lt;ref&gt;David Sneath, &quot;The Impact of the Cultural Revolution in China on the Mongolians of Inner Mongolia&quot;, in ''Modern Asian Studies'', Vol. 28, No. 2 (May, 1994), pp. 409-430&lt;/ref&gt; In 1969 much of Inner Mongolia was distributed among surrounding provinces, with Hulunbuir divided between [[Heilongjiang]] and [[Jilin]], Jirim going to [[Jilin]], Juu Uda to [[Liaoning]], and the Alashan and Ejine region divided among [[Gansu]] and [[Ningxia]]. This was reversed in 1979.

Inner Mongolia has seen considerable development since Deng Xiaoping instituted [[Chinese economic reform]] in 1978. For about ten years since 2000, Inner Mongolia's GDP growth has been among the highest in the country, largely owing to the success of natural resource industries in the region.

==Geography==
{{expand section|date=July 2010}}
[[File:Grasslands-menggu.jpg|thumb|Grasslands in the region]]
Officially Inner Mongolia is classified as one of the provincial-level divisions of [[North China]], but its great stretch means that parts of it belong to [[Northeast China]] and [[Northwest China]] as well. It borders eight provincial-level divisions in all three of the aforementioned regions ([[Heilongjiang]], [[Jilin]], [[Liaoning]], [[Hebei]], [[Shanxi]], [[Shaanxi]], [[Ningxia]], and [[Gansu]]), tying with Shaanxi for the greatest number of bordering provincial-level divisions. Most of its international border is with Mongolia, which, in Chinese, is sometimes called &quot;Outer Mongolia&quot; (外蒙古), while a small portion is with Russia.

===Climate===
Due to its elongated shape, Inner Mongolia has a wide variety of regional climates. Throughout the province, the climate is based off a four-season, [[monsoon]] climate. The winters in Inner Mongolia are very long, cold, and dry with frequent blizzards. The spring, summer, and autumn are polar opposites to the winter. They are short, extremely hot and arid, and have large, dangerous [[sandstorms]]. Officially, most of the region is classified as either a [[cold arid]] or [[Steppe climate|steppe]] regime ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''BWk, BSk'', respectively). The small portion besides these are classified as [[humid continental]] (Köppen ''Dwb'') in the northeast, or [[Subarctic climate|subarctic]] (Köppen ''Dwc'') in the far north near [[Hulunbuir]].&lt;ref&gt;Peel, M. C. and Finlayson, B. L. and McMahon, T. A. (2007). [http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2e/Asia_Koppen_Map.png &quot;Updated world map of the Köppen-Geiger climate classification&quot;]. Hydrol. Earth Syst. Sci. 11: 1633-1644.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Administrative divisions==
{{main|List of administrative divisions of Inner Mongolia|List of township-level divisions of Inner Mongolia}}
Inner Mongolia is divided into 12 [[Administrative divisions of the People's Republic of China#Prefecture level|prefecture-level divisions]]. Until the late 1990s, most of Inner Mongolia's prefectural regions were known as ''[[league (Inner Mongolia)|Leagues]]'' ({{zh|c=盟}}), a usage retained from Mongol divisions of the [[Qing Dynasty]]. Similarly, county-level divisions are often known as ''Banners'' ({{zh|c=旗}}). Since the 1990s, numerous Leagues have converted into prefecture-level cities, although Banners remain. The restructuring led to the conversion of primate cities in most leagues to convert to districts administratively ([[Hailar District|Hailar]], [[Jining District|Jining]], and [[Dongsheng]]). Some newly founded prefecture-level cities have chosen to retain the original name of League (Hulunbuir, Bayannur, and Ulanqab), some have adopted the Chinese name of their [[primate city]] ([[Chifeng]], [[Tongliao]]), and one League, Yekejuu, simply renamed itself [[Ordos City|Ordos]]. Despite these recent administrative changes, there is no indication that the Alxa, Hinggan, and Xilingol Leagues will convert to prefecture-level cities in the near future.

Many of the [[prefecture-level cities]] were converted very recently from [[league (Inner Mongolia)|leagues]].

The twelve [[Administrative divisions of the People's Republic of China#Prefecture level|prefecture-level divisions]] of Inner Mongolia are subdivided into 101 [[Administrative divisions of the People's Republic of China#County level|county-level divisions]], including twenty-one [[District of China|district]]s, eleven [[county-level cities]], seventeen [[County (People's Republic of China)|counties]], forty-nine [[banner (Inner Mongolia)|banners]], and three [[autonomous banner]]s. Those are in turn divided into 1425 [[Administrative divisions of the People's Republic of China#Township level|township-level divisions]], including 532 [[town of China|town]]s, 407 [[Townships of the People's Republic of China|township]]s, 277 [[sumu (Inner Mongolia)|sumu]], eighteen [[ethnic township]]s, one [[ethnic sumu]], and 190 [[subdistrict]]s.

==Economy==
Farming of crops such as [[wheat]] takes precedence along the river valleys. In the more arid grasslands, herding of [[goat]]s, [[sheep]] and so on is a traditional method of subsistence. [[Forestry]] and [[hunting]] are somewhat important in the [[Greater Khingan]] ranges in the east. [[Reindeer]] herding is carried out by [[Evenks]] in the Evenk Autonomous Banner. More recently, growing [[grapes]] and [[winemaking]] have become an economic factor in the [[Wuhai]] area.
[[Image:InnerMongolianTheater.jpg|right|thumb|Theater in [[Hohhot]], Inner Mongolia, [[China]]]]
Inner Mongolia has abundance of resources especially coal, [[Cashmere wool|cashmere]], natural gas, [[rare earth element]]s, and has more deposits of naturally occurring [[niobium]], [[zirconium]] and [[beryllium]] than any other [[province]]-level region in China. However in the past, the exploitation and utilisation of resources were rather inefficient, which resulted in poor returns from rich resources. Inner Mongolia is also an important coal production base, with more than a quarter of the world's coal reserves located in the province.&lt;ref name=&quot;thechinaperspective.com&quot;&gt;http://www.thechinaperspective.com/topics/province/inner-mongolia-autonomous-region/&lt;/ref&gt; It plans to double annual coal output by 2010 (from the 2005 volume of 260 million tons) to 500 million tons of coal a year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.people.com.cn/200512/27/eng20051227_231175.html Inner Mongolia to double annual coal output by 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:InnerMengolianGym.jpg|right|thumb|Inner Mongolia Gymnasium]]
Industry in Inner Mongolia has grown up mainly around coal, [[power generation]], forestry-related industries, and related industries.
Inner Mongolia now encourages six competitive industries: energy, chemicals, metallurgy, equipment manufacturing, processing of farm (including [[dairy]]) produce, and high technology. Well-known Inner Mongolian enterprises include companies such as [[ERDOS]], [[Yili Group|Yili]], and [[Mengniu]].

The nominal GDP of Inner Mongolia in 2010 was 1.16 trillion yuan (US$172.1 billion), a growth of 16.9% from 2008, with an average annual increase of 20% from the period 2003-2007. Its per capita GDP reached 37,287 yuan (US$5,460) in 2009. In 2008, Inner Mongolia's primary, secondary, and tertiary industries were worth 90.7 billion yuan, 427.1 billion yuan, and 258.4 billion yuan respectively. The urban per capita [[disposable income]] and rural per capita net income were 14,431 yuan and 4,656 yuan, up 16.6% and 17.8% respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.people.com.cn/200602/05/eng20060205_240396.html Inner Mongolia's economy maintains a rapid growth momentum]&lt;/ref&gt;

As with much of China, economic growth has led to a boom in construction, including new commercial development and large apartment complexes.

In addition to its large reserves of natural resources, Inner Mongolia also has the largest usable wind power capacity in China&lt;ref name=&quot;thechinaperspective.com&quot;/&gt; thanks to strong winds which develop in the province's grasslands. Some private companies have set up [[Wind power in China|wind parks]] in parts of Inner Mongolia such as [[Bail Miao|Bailingmiao]], Hutengliang and Zhouzi.

==Government and politics==
{{Main|Politics of Inner Mongolia|List of provincial leaders of the People's Republic of China}}

Under the [[Constitution of the People's Republic of China]], articles 112-122, [[autonomous region]]s have limited autonomy in both the political and economic arena.  Autonomous regions have more discretion in administering economic policy in the region in accordance with national guidelines. Structurally, the Chairman — who legally must be an ethnic minority and is usually ethnic Mongolian — is always kept in check by the [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]] Regional Committee Secretary, who is usually from a different part of China (to reduce corruption) and Han Chinese. The current party secretary is [[Hu Chunhua]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://china.org.cn/english/features/40664.htm china.org.cn: Chu Bo]&lt;/ref&gt; The Inner Mongolian government and its subsidiaries follow roughly the same structure as that of a Chinese province. With regards to economic policy, as a part of increased [[Chinese federalism|federalism]] characteristics in China, Inner Mongolia has become more independent in implementing its own economic roadmap.

==Demographics==
{{See also|List of Chinese ethnic groups}}
[[Image:Hohhot Muslim Quarter.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Muslim]]-themed Street in [[Hohhot]]]]

When the autonomous region was established in 1947, Han Chinese comprised 83.6% of the population, while the Mongols comprised 14.8% of the population.&lt;ref&gt;[[Myron Weiner]], Sharon Stanton Russell(2001). Demography and national security. page 276, table 9.4.&lt;/ref&gt;
By the year 2000, the percentage of Han Chinese fell to 79.17%. While the Hetao region along the Yellow River has always alternated between farmers from the south and nomads from the north, the most recent episode of Han Chinese migration began in the early 18th century with encouragement from the [[Qing Dynasty]], and continued into the 20th century. Han Chinese live mostly in the Hetao region as well as various population centres in central and eastern Inner Mongolia. Over 70% of Mongols are concentrated in less than 18% of Inner Mongolia's territory ([[Hinggan League]], and prefectures [[Tongliao]] and [[Chifeng]]).

Mongols are the second largest ethnic group, comprising  17.13% of the population, an increase of 2.33% since 1947. They include many diverse Mongolian-speaking groups; groups such as the [[Buryats]] and the [[Oirats]] are also officially considered to be Mongols in China. Many of the traditionally nomadic Mongols have settled in permanent homes as their pastoral economy was collectivized during the Maoist Era.

Other ethnic groups include the [[Daur people|Daur]], the [[Evenks]], the [[Oroqen people|Oroqen]], the [[Hui people|Hui]], the [[Manchu people|Manchu]]s, and the [[Koreans in China|Koreans]].

[[Image:KFC in Hohhot.jpg|thumb|250px|A [[KFC]] in Hohhot, the capital; All street signs must be bilingual with [[Mongolian Language|Mongol]] and [[Chinese language|Chinese]]]]
The [[Han Chinese]] of Inner Mongolia speak a variety of dialects, depending on the region. The eastern parts tend to speak [[Northeastern Mandarin]], which belongs to the [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] group of dialects; those in the central parts, such as the [[Huang He]] valley, speak varieties of [[Jin Chinese|Jin]], another subdivision of Chinese, due to its proximity to other Jin-speaking areas in China such as the [[Shanxi]] province. Cities such as Hohhot and Baotou both have their unique brand of Jin Chinese such as the [[Zhangjiakou–Hohhot dialect]] which are sometimes incomprehensible with dialects spoken in northeastern regions such as [[Hailar District|Hailar]].

Depending on definition, [[Mongols]] in Inner Mongolia speak dialects of the [[Mongolian language]]&lt;ref&gt;e.g. {{unicode|Sečenbaγatur, Qasgerel, Tuyaγ-a, B. ǰirannige, U Ying ǰe.}} 2005. ''{{unicode|Mongγul kelen-ü nutuγ-un ayalγun-u sinǰilel-ün uduridqal}}''. Kökeqota: ÖMAKQ.&lt;/ref&gt; or Central Mongolic varieties&lt;ref&gt;e.g. [[Juha Janhunen|Janhunen, Juha]] (2006): Mongolic languages. In: Brown, K. (ed.): ''The encyclopedia of language &amp; linguistics''. Amsterdam: Elsevier: 231-234.&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[Chakhar Mongolian]], [[Baarin Mongolian]], Kharchin Mongolian, [[Khorchin Mongolian]], [[Ordos Mongolian|Ordos]], [[Khamnigan Mongol|Khamnigan]], Barghu [[Buryat language|Buryat]] and [[Alasha dialect|Alasha]]. The standard pronunciation of Mongolian in China is based on the Chakhar dialect of the [[Plain Blue Banner, Inner Mongolia|Plain Blue Banner]], located in central Inner Mongolia, while the grammar is based on all [[Southern Mongolian|Southern Mongolian dialects]].&lt;ref&gt;{{unicode|Sečenbaγatur}} et al. 2005: 85&lt;/ref&gt; This is different from independent Mongolia, where the standard pronunciation is based on the closely related [[Khalkha]] dialect. The [[Daur language|Daur]], [[Evenks]], and [[Oroqen language|Oroqin]] speak their own respective languages.

By law, all street signs, commercial outlets, and government documents must be bilingual, written in Mongolian and Chinese. There are three Mongolian TV channels in the Inner Mongolia Satellite TV network. In public transportation, all announcements are to be bilingual. Many ethnic Mongols, especially the young, speak fluent Chinese.  Mongolian is receding in urban areas. But rural ethnic Mongols have kept more of their traditions. In terms of written language, Inner Mongolia has retained the [[Mongolian script|classic Mongol written script]] as opposed to Outer Mongolia's adoption of [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]].

The vast grasslands have long symbolised Inner Mongolia. Mongolian art often depicts the grassland in an uplifting fashion and emphasizes Mongolian nomadic traditions. The [[Mongol]]s of Inner Mongolia still practice their traditional arts. Inner Mongolian cuisine has Mongol roots and consists of [[dairy]]-related products and ''hand-held lamb'' (手扒肉). In recent years, franchises based on [[Hot pot]] have appeared Inner Mongolia, the most famous of which is ''[[Xiaofeiyang]]'' (小肥羊). Famous Inner Mongolian commercial brand names include [[Mengniu]] and [[Yili Group|Yili]], both of which began as dairy product and [[ice cream]] producers.

Among the [[Han Chinese]] of Inner Mongolia, Jinju (晉劇) or [[Shanxi Opera]] is a popular traditional form of entertainment. See also: [[Shanxi]].

The famous actress [[Siqin Gaowa]] is an ethnic Mongol from Inner Mongolia.

A popular career in Inner Mongolia is circus acrobatics. The famous Inner Mongolia Acrobatic Troupe travels and performs with the renowned Ringling Bros. and Barnum and Bailey Circus.

==Chinese space programme==
One of China's space vehicle launch facilities, [[Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center]] (JSLC) ({{zh|s=酒泉卫星发射中心}}), is located in the extreme west of Inner Mongolia, in the [[Alxa League]]'s [[Ejin Banner]], about 1,600&amp;nbsp;km from [[Beijing]]. It was founded in 1958, making it the PRC's first launch facility. More Chinese launches have occurred at Jiuquan than anywhere else. As with all Chinese launch facilities, it is remote and generally closed to the public. It is named as such since Jiuquan is the nearest urban centre, although Jiuquan is in the nearby province of Gansu. Many space vehicles have also made their touchdowns in Inner Mongolia. For example, the crew of [[Shenzhou 6]] landed in [[Siziwang Banner]], near [[Hohhot]].

{{Nanking Massacre}}

The '''Nanking Massacre''' or '''Nanjing Massacre''', also known as the '''Rape of Nanking''', was a [[mass murder]]  and [[war rape]] that occurred during the six-week period following the Japanese [[Battle of Nanking|capture]] of the city of [[Nanjing|Nanking]] (Nanjing), the former capital of the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]], on December 13, 1937 during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]]. During this period, hundreds of thousands of Chinese civilians and disarmed soldiers were murdered by soldiers of the [[Imperial Japanese Army]].&lt;ref&gt;Levene, Mark and Roberts, Penny. ''The Massacre in History''. 1999, page 223-4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tot&gt;Totten, Samuel. ''Dictionary of Genocide''. 2008, 298–9.&lt;/ref&gt; Widespread rape and looting also occurred.&lt;ref&gt;Iris Chang, ''The Rape of Nanking'', p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.salon.com/2010/03/31/as_film_japan_massacre_documentary/ | author = Lee, Min | title = New film has Japan vets confessing to Nanjing rape | publisher = Salon/Associated Press | date = March 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historians and witnesses have estimated that 250,000 to 300,000 people were killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/223038.stm | title = Scarred by history: The Rape of Nanjing| publisher=BBC News | date = April 11, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several of the key perpetrators of the atrocities, at the time labelled as [[war crime]]s, were later tried and found guilty at the [[Nanjing War Crimes Tribunal]], and were subsequently executed. Another key perpetrator, [[Prince Yasuhiko Asaka|Prince Asaka]], a member of the [[Imperial House of Japan|Imperial Family]], escaped prosecution by having earlier been granted immunity by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]].

The event remains a contentious political issue, as various aspects of it have been disputed by some [[Historical revisionism (negationism)|historical revisionists]] and [[Japanese nationalism|Japanese nationalists]],&lt;ref name=tot /&gt; who have claimed that the massacre has been either exaggerated or wholly fabricated for propaganda purposes. As a result of the nationalist efforts to deny or rationalize the war crimes, the [[Nanking Massacre controversy|controversy]] surrounding the massacre remains a stumbling block in [[People's Republic of China–Japan relations|Sino-Japanese relations]], as well as Japanese relations with other Asia-Pacific nations such as [[South Korea]] and the [[Philippines]].

An accurate estimation of the death toll in the massacre has not been achieved because most of the Japanese military records on the killings were deliberately destroyed or kept secret shortly after the [[surrender of Japan]] in 1945. The [[International Military Tribunal of the Far East]] estimates more than 200,000 casualties in the incident;&lt;ref name=&quot;IMTFE&quot;/&gt; China's official estimate is about 300,000 casualties, based on the evaluation of the [[Nanjing War Crimes Tribunal]]. Estimates from Japanese historians vary widely, in the vicinity of 40,000–200,000. Some historical revisionists even deny that a widespread, systematic massacre occurred at all, claiming that any deaths were either justified militarily, accidental or isolated incidents of unauthorized atrocities. These revisionists claim that the characterization of the incident as a large-scale, systematic massacre was fabricated for the purpose of political propaganda.&lt;ref&gt;Fogel, Joshua A. ''The Nanjing Massacre in History and Historiography''. 2000, page 46-8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dillon&gt;Dillon, Dana R. ''The China Challenge''. 2007, page 9-10&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the [[government of Japan|Japanese government]] has admitted to the acts of killing of a large number of noncombatants, looting and other violence committed by the Imperial Japanese Army after the fall of Nanking,&lt;ref name=&quot;mofa_jp&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.mofa.go.jp/policy/q_a/faq16.html#q8 | title = Q8: What is the view of the Government of Japan on the incident known as the &quot;Nanjing Massacre&quot;? | work = Foreign Policy Q&amp;A | publisher = Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;I'm Sorry&quot;&gt;{{cite episode | title = I'm Sorry? | series = NewsHour with Jim Lehrer | airdate = 1998-12-01 | url = http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/asia/july-dec98/china_12-1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; a small but vocal minority within both the Japanese government and society have argued that the death toll was military in nature and that no such crimes ever occurred. Denial of the massacre (and a divergent array of revisionist accounts of the killings) has become a staple of [[Japanese nationalism]].&lt;ref name=yoshida&gt;Yoshida, Takashi. ''The Making of the &quot;Rape of Nanking&quot;''. 2006, page 157-8.&lt;/ref&gt; In Japan, public opinion of the massacres varies, and few deny the occurrence of the massacre outright.&lt;ref name=yoshida /&gt; Nonetheless, recurring attempts by [[historical revisionism (negationism)|negationists]] to promote a revisionist history of the incident have created controversy that periodically reverberates in the international media, particularly in China, South Korea, and other [[East Asia]]n nations.&lt;ref name=gall&gt;Gallicchio, Marc S. ''The Unpredictability of the Past''. 2007, page 158.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Military situation ==

In August 1937, the Japanese army [[Battle of Shanghai|invaded Shanghai]] where they met strong resistance and suffered heavy casualties. The battle was bloody as both sides faced attrition in urban hand-to-hand combat. By mid-November the Japanese had captured [[Shanghai]] with the help of naval bombardment. The General Staff Headquarters in Tokyo initially decided not to expand the war due to heavy casualties and low morale of the troops. However, on December 1, headquarters ordered the Central China Area Army and the 10th Army to capture [[Nanking]], then-capital of the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]].

=== Relocation of the capital ===

After losing the Battle of Shanghai, [[Chiang Kai-shek]] knew that the fall of Nanking would simply be a matter of time. He and his staff realized that they could not risk the annihilation of their elite troops in a symbolic but hopeless defense of the capital. In order to preserve the army for future battles, most of them were withdrawn. Chiang's strategy was to follow the suggestion of his German advisers to draw the Japanese army deep into China utilizing China's vast territory as a defensive strength. Chiang planned to fight a protracted [[Attrition warfare|war of attrition]] by wearing down the Japanese in the hinterland of China.&lt;ref name=&quot;Higashinakano Shudo, Kobayashi Susumu &amp; Fukunaga Shainjiro 2005 author=Higashinakano Shudo, Kobayashi Susumu &amp; Fukunaga Shainjiro&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.sdh-fact.com/CL02_1/26_S4.pdf | year = 2005 | author = Higashinakano Shudo, Kobayashi Susumu &amp; Fukunaga Shainjiro | title = Analyzing the &quot;Photographic Evidence&quot; of the Nanking Massacre (originally published as Nankin Jiken: &quot;Shokoshashin&quot; wo Kenshosuru) | publisher = Soshisha
 | location = Tokyo, Japan }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leaving General [[Tang Shengzhi]] in charge of the city for the Battle of Nanking, Chiang and many of his advisors flew to [[Wuhan]], where they stayed until it was [[battle of Wuhan|attacked in 1938]].

=== Strategy for the defense of Nanking ===

In a press release to foreign reporters, Tang Shengzhi announced the city would not surrender and would fight to the death. Tang gathered about 100,000 soldiers, largely untrained, including Chinese troops who had participated in the [[Battle of Shanghai]]. To prevent civilians from fleeing the city, he ordered troops to guard the port, as instructed by Chiang Kai-shek.  The defense force blocked roads, destroyed boats, and burnt nearby villages, preventing widespread evacuation.

The Chinese government left for relocation on December 1, and the president left on December 7, leaving the fate of Nanking to an International Committee led by [[John Rabe]].

The defense plan fell apart quickly. Those defending the city encountered Chinese troops fleeing from previous defeats such as the Battle of Shanghai, running from the advancing Japanese army. This did nothing to help the morale of the defenders, many of whom were killed during the defense of the city and subsequent Japanese occupation.

[[File:Republic of China Armed Forces Museum Nanking.jpg|thumb|upright|Sword used in the &quot;contest&quot; on display at the [[Republic of China Armed Forces Museum]] in Taipei, Taiwan]]

Although the Nanking Massacre is generally described as having occurred over a six-week period after the fall of Nanking, the crimes committed by the Japanese army were not limited to that period. Many atrocities were reported to have been committed as the Japanese army advanced from Shanghai to Nanking.

According to one Japanese journalist embedded with Imperial forces at the time, &quot;The reason that the [10th Army] is advancing to Nanking quite rapidly is due to the tacit consent among the officers and men that they could loot and rape as they wish.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Cummins, Joseph. ''The World's Bloodiest History''. 2009, page 149.&lt;/ref&gt;

Novelist [[Ishikawa Tatsuzo]] vividly described how the 16th Division of the Shanghai Expeditionary Force committed atrocities on the march between Shanghai and Nanking in his novel ''Ikiteiru Heitai'' (Living Soldiers), which was based on interviews that Tatsuzo conducted with troops in Nanking in January 1938.&lt;ref&gt;

Katsuichi Honda, Frank Gibney, The Nanjing massacre: a Japanese journalist confronts Japan's national shame, 39–41&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the most notorious atrocity was a [[Contest to kill 100 people using a sword|killing contest between two Japanese officers]] as reported in the ''Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun'' and the English language ''Japan Advertiser''. The contest was covered much like a sporting event with regular updates on the score over a series of days.&lt;ref&gt;Tokyo Nichi Nichi, 13 December 1937 article on the killing contest.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Japan Advertiser, 7 December 1937 (an American owned and edited English-language daily paper in Tokyo)&lt;/ref&gt; In Japan, the veracity of the newspaper article about the contest was the subject of ferocious debate for several decades starting in 1967.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kingston_2008_9&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Kingston|2008|p=9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, a historian concurred with certain Japanese scholars who had argued that the contest was a concocted story, with the collusion of the soldiers themselves for the purpose of raising the [[Yamato-damashii|national fighting spirit]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Wakabayashi Summer 2000 307&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | first = Bob Tadashi | last = Wakabayashi | title = The Nanking 100-Man Killing Contest Debate: War Guilt Amid Fabricated Illusions, 1971–75 | journal = The Journal of Japanese Studies | volume = 26 | issue = 2 | year = Summer 2000 | page = 307 | jstor=133271}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, a Tokyo district judge dismissed a suit by the families of the lieutenants, stating that &quot;the lieutenants admitted the fact that they raced to kill 100 people&quot; and that the story cannot be proven to be clearly false.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2005/08/japanese-court-rules-newspaper-didnt.php | title = Jurist - Paper Chase: Japanese court rules newspaper didn't fabricate 1937 Chinese killing game | publisher = Jurist.law.pitt.edu | date = 2005-08-23 | accessdate = 2011-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The judge also ruled against the civil claim of the plaintiffs because the original article was more than 60 years old.&lt;ref&gt;[http://andesfolklore.hp.infoseek.co.jp/intisol/hyakunin/hanketu4.htm Andesfolklore.hp.infoseek.co.jp]&lt;/ref&gt;　The historicity of the event remains disputed in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/the-scars-of-nanking-memories-of-a-japanese-outrage-764827.html | location = London | work = The Independent | title = The scars of Nanking: Memories of a Japanese outrage | date = December 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Flight of Chinese civilians ===

As the Japanese army drew closer to Nanking, Chinese civilians fled the city in droves. The people of Nanking fled in panic not only because of the dangers of the anticipated battle but also because they feared the deprivation inherent in the [[scorched earth]] strategy that the Chinese troops were implementing in the area surrounding the city.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

On July 31, the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) had issued a statement that they were determined to turn every Chinese national and every piece of their soil into ash, rather than turn them over to the opponent. The Nanking garrison force set fire to buildings and houses in the areas close to [[Xiakuan]] to the north as well as in the environs of the eastern and southern city gates.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Targets within and outside of the city walls—such as military barracks, private homes, the Chinese Ministry of Communication, forests and even entire villages—were burnt to cinders, at an estimated value of 20 to 30 million (1937) US dollars.&lt;ref name=&quot;doomed&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.geocities.com/nankingatrocities/Fall/fall_01.htm | title = Five Western Journalists in the Doomed City | accessdate = 2006-04-19 | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20050325115933/http://www.geocities.com/nankingatrocities/Fall/fall_01.htm | archivedate = 2005-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ne.jp/asahi/unko/tamezou/nankin/1937-12-08-NewYorkTimesTillmanDurdin.html | title = Chinese Fight Foe Outside Nanking; See Seeks's Stand | accessdate = 2006-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ne.jp/asahi/unko/tamezou/nankin/1937-12-09-NewYorkTimesHallettAbend.html | title = Japan Lays Gain to Massing of Foe | accessdate = 2006-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Establishment of the Nanking Safety Zone ===
{{Main|Nanking Safety Zone}}

Many Westerners were living in the city at that time, conducting trade or on missionary trips. As the Japanese army approached Nanking, most of them fled the city, leaving 27 foreigners. Five of these were journalists who remained in the city a few days after it was captured, leaving the city on December 16. Fifteen of the remaining 22 foreigners formed a committee, called the [[International Committee for the Nanking Safety Zone]] in the western quarter of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = David | last = Askew | title = The International Committee for the Nanking Safety Zone: An Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Germany|German]] businessman [[John Rabe]] was elected as its leader, in part because of his status as a member of the [[Nazi Party]] and the existence of the German-Japanese bilateral [[Anti-Comintern Pact]].

The Japanese government had previously agreed not to attack parts of the city that did not contain Chinese military forces, and the members of the Committee managed to persuade the Chinese government to move their troops out of the area.

On December 1, 1937, Nanking Mayor Ma Chao-chun ordered all Chinese citizens remaining in Nanking to move into the “Safety Zone”.  Many fled the city on December 7, and the International Committee took over as the ''[[de facto]]'' government of Nanking.

=== Prince Asaka appointed as commander ===
[[File:Asakanomiya yasuhiko.jpg|upright|thumb|Prince [[Yasuhiko Asaka]] in 1940]]
[[File:Chinese head, Nanking massacre.JPG|thumb|left|Head of a Chinese man beheaded by Japanese is wedged in a barricade near Nanking just before the fall of the city.&lt;ref&gt;''Life'', January 10, 1938, page 51.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In a memorandum for the palace rolls, Hirohito had singled [[Prince Asaka Yasuhiko]] out for censure as the one imperial kinsman whose attitude was &quot;not good.&quot; He assigned Asaka to Nanking as an opportunity to make amends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = David | last = Bergamini | title=Japan's Imperial Conspiracy | page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 5, Asaka left Tokyo by plane and arrived at the front three days later. Asaka met with division commanders, lieutenant-generals [[Kesago Nakajima]] and [[Heisuke Yanagawa]], who informed him that the Japanese troops had almost completely surrounded 300,000 Chinese troops in the vicinity of Nanking and that preliminary negotiations suggested that the Chinese were ready to surrender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = David | last = Bergamini | title = Japan's Imperial Conspiracy | page = 24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prince Asaka allegedly issued an order to &quot;kill all captives,&quot; thus providing official sanction for the crimes which took place during and after the battle.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chen, World War II Database&quot;&gt;Chen, World War II Database&lt;/ref&gt; Some authors record that Prince Asaka signed the order for Japanese soldiers in Nanking to &quot;kill all captives&quot;&lt;ref&gt;
David Bergamini, ''Japan's imperial Conspiracy'', 1971, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; Others claim that lieutenant colonel [[Isamu Chō]], Asaka's [[aide-de-camp]], sent this order under the Prince's sign manual without the Prince's knowledge or assent.&lt;ref&gt;Iris Chang, ''The Rape of Nanking'', 1997, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; However, even if Chō took the initiative on his own, Prince Asaka, who was nominally the officer in charge, gave no orders to stop the carnage. When General [[Iwane Matsui|Matsui]] arrived in the city four days after the massacre had begun, he issued strict orders that resulted in the eventual end of the massacre.

While the extent of Prince Asaka's responsibility for the massacre remains a matter of debate, the ultimate sanction for the massacre and the crimes committed during the invasion of China were issued in Emperor [[Hirohito]]'s ratification of the Japanese army's proposition to remove the constraints of [[international law]] on the treatment of Chinese prisoners on August 5, 1937.&lt;ref&gt;

== Battle of Nanking ==
{{Main|Battle of Nanking}}

=== Siege of the city ===

The Japanese military continued to move forward, breaching the last lines of Chinese resistance, and arriving outside the walled city of Nanking on December 9.

=== Demand for surrender ===

At noon on December 9, the military dropped leaflets into the city, urging the surrender of Nanking within 24 hours, promising annihilation if refused.&lt;ref name=&quot;shanghai&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = Kajimoto | first = Masato | url = http://www.geocities.com/nankingatrocities/Introduction/introduction.htm | title = Battle of Shanghai | accessdate = 2006-04-19 | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060205002859/http://www.geocities.com/nankingatrocities/Introduction/introduction.htm | archivedate = 2006-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|

Quote: &quot;The Japanese Army, one million strong, has already conquered [[Changshu]]. We have surrounded the city of Nanking... The Japanese Army shall show no mercy toward those who offer resistance, treating them with extreme severity, but shall harm neither innocent civilians nor Chinese military [personnel] who manifest no hostility. It is our earnest desire to preserve the East Asian culture. If your troops continue to fight, war in Nanking is inevitable. The culture that has endured for a millennium will be reduced to ashes, and the government that has lasted for a decade will vanish into thin air. This commander-in-chief issues [b]ills to your troops on behalf of the Japanese Army. Open the gates to Nanking in a peaceful manner, and obey the [f]ollowing instructions.&quot;|group=&quot;N&quot;}}

Meanwhile, members of the Committee contacted Tang and suggested a plan for three-day cease-fire, during which the Chinese troops could withdraw without fighting while the Japanese troops would stay in their present position.

General Tang agreed with this proposal if the International Committee could acquire permission of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, who had already fled to Hankow to which he had temporarily shifted the military headquarters two days earlier.

John Rabe boarded the U.S. gunboat Panay on December 9 and sent two telegrams, one to Chiang Kai-shek by way of the American ambassador in Hankow, and one to the Japanese military authority in Shanghai. The next day he was informed that Chiang Kai-shek, who had ordered that Nanking be defended &quot;to the last man,&quot; had refused to accept the proposal.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

=== Assault and capture of Nanking ===
[[File:Iwane Matsui rides into Nanjing.jpg|thumb|[[Iwane Matsui]] enters Nanking]]

The Japanese awaited an answer to their demand for surrender but no response was received from the Chinese by the deadline on December 10. General [[Matsui Iwane]] waited another hour before issuing the command to take Nanking by force. The Japanese army mounted its assault on the Nanking walls from multiple directions; the SEF’s 16th Division attacked three gates on the eastern side, the 6th Division of the 10A launched its offensive on the western walls, and the SEF’s 9th Division advanced into the area in-between.&lt;ref name=&quot;Higashinakano Shudo, Kobayashi Susumu &amp; Fukunaga Shainjiro 2005 author=Higashinakano Shudo, Kobayashi Susumu &amp; Fukunaga Shainjiro&quot; /&gt;

On December 12, under heavy artillery fire and aerial bombardment, General Tang Sheng-chi ordered his men to retreat. What followed was nothing short of chaos. Some Chinese soldiers stripped civilians of their clothing in a desperate attempt to blend in, and many others were shot by the Chinese supervisory unit as they tried to flee.&lt;ref name=&quot;doomed&quot;/&gt;

On 13 December, the 6th and the 116th Divisions of the Japanese Army were the first to enter the city, facing little military resistance. Simultaneously, the 9th Division entered nearby Guanghua Gate, and the 16th Division entered the Zhongshan and Taiping gates. That same afternoon, two small [[Imperial Japanese Navy|Japanese Navy]] fleets arrived on both sides of the Yangtze River.

=== Pursuit and mopping-up operations ===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-U1002-502, Japanisch-Chinesischer Krieg.jpg|thumb|left|Soldiers from the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] enter Nanking in January 1938]]

Japanese troops pursued the retreating Chinese army units, primarily in the [[Xiakuan]] area to the north of the city walls and around the [[Zijin Mountain]] in the east. Although most sources suggest that the final phase of the battle consisted of a one-sided slaughter of Chinese troops by the Japanese, some Japanese historians maintain that the remaining Chinese military still posed a serious threat to the Japanese. Prince Yasuhiko Asaka told a war correspondent later that he was in a very perilous position when his headquarters was ambushed by Chinese forces that were in the midst of fleeing from Nanking east of the city. On the other side of the city, the 11th Company of the 45th Regiment encountered some 20,000 Chinese soldiers who were making their way from Xiakuan.&lt;ref name=&quot;Higashinakano Shudo, Kobayashi Susumu &amp; Fukunaga Shainjiro 2005 author=Higashinakano Shudo, Kobayashi Susumu &amp; Fukunaga Shainjiro&quot;/&gt;

The Japanese army conducted its mopping-up operation both inside and outside the [[Nanking Safety Zone]]. Since the area outside the safety zone had been almost completely evacuated, the mopping-up effort was concentrated in the safety zone. The safety zone, an area of 3.85 square kilometres, was literally packed with the remaining population of Nanking. The Japanese army leadership assigned sections of the safety zone to some units to separate alleged plain-clothed soldiers from the civilians.&lt;ref name=&quot;Higashinakano Shudo, Kobayashi Susumu &amp; Fukunaga Shainjiro 2005 author=Higashinakano Shudo, Kobayashi Susumu &amp; Fukunaga Shainjiro&quot; /&gt;

== Massacre ==

Eyewitness accounts of Westerners and Chinese present at Nanking in the weeks after the fall of the city state that over the course of six weeks following the fall of Nanking, Japanese troops engaged in rape, murder, theft, arson, and other war crimes. Some of these accounts came from foreigners who opted to stay behind in order to protect Chinese civilians from harm, including the diaries of [[John Rabe]] and American [[Minnie Vautrin]]. Other accounts include first-person testimonies of Nanking Massacre survivors, eyewitness reports of journalists (both Western and Japanese), as well as the field diaries of military personnel. American missionary [[John Magee (priest)|John Magee]] stayed behind to provide a 16&amp;nbsp;mm [[film]] [[Documentary film|documentary]] and first-hand photographs of the Nanking Massacre.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

A group of foreign expatriates headed by Rabe had formed the 15-man International Committee on November 22 and mapped out the [[Nanking Safety Zone]] in order to safeguard civilians in the city, where the population numbered from 200,000 to 250,000. Rabe and American missionary Lewis S. C. Smythe, secretary of the International Committee and a professor of [[sociology]] at the [[University of Nanking]], recorded the actions of the Japanese troops and filed complaints to the Japanese embassy.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

=== Massacre Contest ===
{{Main|Contest to kill 100 people using a sword}}
In 1937, the Osaka Mainichi Shimbun and its sister newspaper the Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun covered a &quot;contest&quot; between two Japanese officers, Toshiaki Mukai (向井敏明) and Tsuyoshi Noda (野田毅), both from Island troops, the Japanese 16th Division, in which the two men were described as vying with one another to be the first to kill 100 people with a sword before the capture of Nanking. From Jurong to Tangshan (two cities in Jiangshu Province, China), Toshiaki Mukai had killed 89 people while Tsuyoshi Noda had killed 78 people. The contest continued because neither of them had killed 100 people. When they got to Zijin Mountain, Tsuyoshi Noda had killed 105 people while Toshiaki Mukai killed 106 people. Both officers supposedly surpassed their goal during the heat of battle, making it impossible to determine which officer had actually won the contest. Therefore (according to the journalists Asami Kazuo and Suzuki Jiro, writing in the Tokyo Nichi-Nichi Shimbun of December 13), they decided to begin another contest, with the aim being 150 kills.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wakabayashi_2000_319&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Wakabayashi|2000|p=319}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Nichi Nichi headline of the story of December 13 read &quot;'Incredible Record' [in the Contest to] Behead 100 People—Mukai 106 – 105 Noda—Both 2nd Lieutenants Go Into Extra Innings&quot;.

After Japan surrendered, Toshiaki Mukai and Tsuyoshi Noda were arrested and executed by shooting in Nanking with the criminal charge “Civilized Public Enemy”.&lt;ref&gt;国防部审判战犯军事法庭对战犯向井敏明等人的判决书. 民国史档案资料丛书——侵华日军南京大屠杀档案. 1947年12月18日:  616-621.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Military Tribunal for the Far East]] estimated that 20,000 women were raped, including infants and the elderly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/PTO/IMTFE/IMTFE-8.html Paragraph 2, p. 1012, Judgment International Military Tribunal for the Far East].&lt;/ref&gt; A large portion of these rapes were systematized in a process where soldiers would search door-to-door for young girls, with many women taken captive and [[gang rape]]d.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://museums.cnd.org/njmassacre/njm-tran/ | title = Japanese Imperialism and the Massacre in Nanjing: Chapter X: Widespread Incidents of Rape | publisher = Museums.cnd.org | date = | accessdate = 2011-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The women were often killed immediately after being raped, often through explicit [[mutilation]]&lt;ref&gt;&quot;A Debt of Blood: An Eyewitness Account of the Barbarous Acts of the Japanese Invaders in Nanjing,&quot; 7 February 1938, Dagong Daily, Wuhan edition [http://museums.cnd.org/njmassacre/njm-tran/njm-ch10.htm Museums.cnd.org]&lt;/ref&gt; or by stabbing a bayonet, long stick of bamboo, or other objects into the vagina.

On 19 December 1937, Reverend James M. McCallum wrote in his diary:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I know not where to end. Never I have heard or read such brutality. Rape! Rape! Rape! We estimate at least 1,000 cases a night, and many by day. In case of resistance or anything that seems like disapproval, there is a bayonet stab or a bullet&amp;nbsp;... People are hysterical&amp;nbsp;... Women are being carried off every morning, afternoon and evening. The whole Japanese army seems to be free to go and come as it pleases, and to do whatever it pleases.&lt;ref&gt;Hua-ling Hu, ''[[American Goddess at the Rape of Nanking: The Courage of Minnie Vautrin]]'', 2000, p.97&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On March 7, 1938, [[Robert O. Wilson]], a surgeon at the American-administered University Hospital in the Safety Zone, wrote in a letter to his family, &quot;a conservative estimate of people slaughtered in cold blood is somewhere about 100,000, including of course thousands of soldiers that had thrown down their arms&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Documents on the Rape of Nanking, 254.&lt;/ref&gt;

Here are two excerpts from his letters of 15 and 18 December 1937 to his family:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The slaughter of civilians is appalling. I could go on for pages telling of cases of rape and brutality almost beyond belief. Two bayoneted corpses are the only survivors of seven street cleaners who were sitting in their headquarters when Japanese soldiers came in without warning or reason and killed five of their number and wounded the two that found their way to the hospital. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Let me recount some instances occurring in the last two days. Last night the house of one of the Chinese staff members of the university was broken into and two of the women, his relatives, were raped. Two girls, about 16, were raped to death in one of the refugee camps. In the University Middle School where there are 8,000 people the Japs came in ten times last night, over the wall, stole food, clothing, and raped until they were satisfied. They bayoneted one little boy of eight who have {{sic}} five bayonet wounds including one that penetrated his stomach, a portion of omentum was outside the abdomen. I think he will live.&lt;ref&gt;Zhang, Kaiyuan. ''Eyewitness to Massacre: American Missionaries Bear Witness to Japanese Atrocities in Nanjing''. M. E. Sharpe, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

In his diary kept during the aggression against the city and its occupation by the [[Imperial Japanese Army]], the leader of the Safety Zone, [[John Rabe]], wrote many comments about Japanese atrocities. For 17 December:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Two Japanese soldiers have climbed over the garden wall and are about to break into our house. When I appear they give the excuse that they saw two Chinese soldiers climb over the wall. When I show them my party badge, they return the same way. In one of the houses in the narrow street behind my garden wall, a woman was raped, and then wounded in the neck with a bayonet. I managed to get an ambulance so we can take her to Kulou Hospital ... Last night up to 1,000 women and girls are said to have been raped, about 100 girls at Ginling College Girls alone. You hear nothing but rape. If husbands or brothers intervene, they're shot. What you hear and see on all sides is the brutality and bestiality of the Japanese soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = John E. | last = Woods | title = The Good man of Nanking, the Diaries of John Rabe | year = 1998 | page = 77}}&lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

There are also accounts of Japanese troops forcing families to commit acts of [[incest]].&lt;ref name=RapeOfNankingP95&gt;P. 95, The Rape of Nanking, Iris Chang, Penguin Books, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Sons were forced to rape their mothers, fathers were forced to rape daughters. One pregnant woman who was gang-raped by Japanese soldiers gave birth only a few hours later; although the baby appeared to be physically unharmed (Robert B. Edgerton, ''Warriors of the Rising Sun''). Monks who had declared a life of [[celibacy]] were also forced to rape women.

=== Massacre of civilians ===
[[File:Boy killed in Nanking massacre.jpg|thumb|upright|A boy killed by a Japanese soldier with the butt of a rifle, because he did not take off his hat.]]

Following the capture of Nanking, a massacre was perpetrated by the Japanese army, which led to the deaths, estimated by several, of over 250,000 residents in the city, a figure difficult to calculate precisely due to the many bodies deliberately burnt, buried in mass graves, or deposited in the Yangtze River by the IJA.&lt;ref name=&quot;ChristianScienceMonitor&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;IMTftFE&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hata &quot; /&gt; Japanese ultra-nationalists have strongly disputed such death tolls, with some stating that only several hundred civilians were killed during the massacre.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tanaka&quot; /&gt; B. Campbell, in an article published in the journal ''[[Sociological Theory]]'', has described the Nanking Massacre as a [[genocide]] considering the fact that the residents were still unilaterally killed in masses during the aftermath, despite the successful and certain outcome in battle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Campbell | first = Bradley | title = Genocide as social control | journal = Sociological Theory | year = 2009 | month = June | volume = 27 | issue = 2 | page = 154 | jstor = 40376129 | quote = Also, genocide may occur in the aftermath of warfare when mass killings continue after the outcome of a battle or a war has been decided. For instance, after the Chinese city of Nanking was occupied by the Japanese in December 1937, Japanese soldiers massacred over 250,000 residents of the city.}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 December 1937, John Rabe wrote in his diary:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is not until we tour the city that we learn the extent of destruction. We come across corpses every 100 to 200 yards. The bodies of civilians that I examined had bullet holes in their backs. These people had presumably been fleeing and were shot from behind. The Japanese march through the city in groups of ten to twenty soldiers and loot the shops (...) I watched with my own eyes as they looted the café of our German baker Herr Kiessling. Hempel's hotel was broken into as well, as almost every shop on Chung Shang and Taiping Road.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = John E. | last = Woods | title = The Good man of Nanking, the Diaries of John Rabe | year = 1998 | page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On 10 February 1938, Legation Secretary of the German Embassy, Rosen, wrote to his Foreign Ministry about a film made in December by Reverend [[John Magee (missionary)|John Magee]] to recommend its purchase. Here is an excerpt from his letter and a description of some of its shots, kept in the Political Archives of the Foreign Ministry in Berlin.

&lt;blockquote&gt;During the Japanese reign of terror in Nanking – which, by the way, continues to this day to a considerable degree{{spaced ndash}}the Reverend John Magee, a member of the American Episcopal Church Mission who has been here for almost a quarter of a century, took motion pictures that eloquently bear witness to the atrocities committed by the Japanese .... One will have to wait and see whether the highest officers in the Japanese army succeed, as they have indicated, in stopping the activities of their troops, which continue even today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = John E. | last = Woods | title = The Good man of Nanking, the Diaries of John Rabe | year = 1998 | page = 187}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;On December 13, about 30 soldiers came to a Chinese house at #5 Hsing Lu Koo in the southeastern part of Nanking, and demanded entrance. The door was open by the landlord, a [[Islam in China|Mohammedan]] named Ha. They killed him immediately with a revolver and also Mrs. Ha, who knelt before them after Ha's death, begging them not to kill anyone else. Mrs. Ha asked them why they killed her husband and they shot her. Mrs. Hsia was dragged out from under a table in the guest hall where she had tried to hide with her 1 year old baby. After being stripped and raped by one or more men, she was bayoneted in the chest, and then had a bottle thrust into her vagina. The baby was killed with a bayonet. Some soldiers then went to the next room, where Mrs. Hsia's parents, aged 76 and 74, and her two daughters aged 16 and 14. They were about to rape the girls when the grandmother tried to protect them. The soldiers killed her with a revolver. The grandfather grasped the body of his wife and was killed. The two girls were then stripped, the elder being raped by 2–3 men, and the younger by 3. The older girl was stabbed afterwards and a cane was rammed in her vagina. The younger girl was bayoneted also but was spared the horrible treatment that had been meted out to her sister and mother. The soldiers then bayoneted another sister of between 7–8, who was also in the room. The last murders in the house were of Ha's two children, aged 4 and 2 respectively.

Pregnant women were a target of murder, as they would often be bayoneted in the stomach, sometimes after rape. Tang Junshan, survivor and witness to one of the Japanese army’s systematic mass killings, testified:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The seventh and last person in the first row was a pregnant woman. The soldier thought he might as well rape her before killing her, so he pulled her out of the group to a spot about ten meters away. As he was trying to rape her, the woman resisted fiercely&amp;nbsp;... The soldier abruptly stabbed her in the belly with a bayonet. She gave a final scream as her intestines spilled out. Then the soldier stabbed the fetus, with its umbilical cord clearly visible, and tossed it aside.&lt;ref&gt;{{PDFlink | [http://bootheprize.stanford.edu/0506/PWR-Yang.pdf The Memorial Hall for the Victims of the Nanjing Massacre: Rhetoric in the Face of Tragedy] | 310&amp;nbsp;KB}}, Celia Yang, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Extrajudicial killing of Chinese POWs ===

On August 6, 1937, [[Hirohito]] had personally ratified his army's proposition to remove the constraints of international law on the treatment of Chinese prisoners. This directive also advised staff officers to stop using the term &quot;[[prisoner of war]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Fujiwara | first = Akira | year = 1995 | title = Nitchû Sensô ni Okeru Horyotoshido Gyakusatsu | journal = Kikan Sensô Sekinin Kenkyû | volume = 9 |issue= | page = 22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Immediately after the fall of the city, Japanese troops embarked on a determined search for former soldiers, in which thousands of young men were captured. Many were taken to the [[Yangtze River]], where they were machine-gunned. What was probably the single largest massacre of Chinese troops occurred along the banks of the Yangtze River on December 18 in what is called the Straw String Gorge Massacre. Japanese soldiers took most of the morning tying all of the POWs hands together and in the dusk divided them into 4 columns, and opened fire at them. Unable to escape, the POWs could only scream and thrash in desperation. It took an hour for the sounds of death to stop, and even longer for the Japanese to bayonet each individual. Most were dumped into the Yangtze. It is estimated that at least 57,500 Chinese POWs were killed.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

The Japanese troops gathered 1,300 Chinese soldiers and civilians at Taiping Gate and killed them. The victims were blown up with landmines, then doused with petrol before being set on fire.  Those that were left alive afterward were killed with bayonets.&lt;ref name=&quot;Taiping&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7140357.stm | title = Nanjing remembers massacre victims | publisher = BBC News | date = 2007-12-13 | accessdate=2007-12-13 | first = Michael | last = Bristow}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[F.

Durdin, who was working for the [[New York Times]], made a tour of Nanking before his departure from the city. He heard waves of machine-gun fire and witnessed the Japanese soldiers gun down some two hundred Chinese within ten minutes. Two days later, in his report to the ''New York Times'', he stated that the alleys and street were filled with civilian bodies, including women and children.&lt;ref&gt;

=== Theft and arson ===

One-third of the city was destroyed as a result of arson. According to reports, Japanese troops torched newly built government buildings as well as the homes of many civilians. There was considerable destruction to areas outside the city walls. Soldiers pillaged from the poor and the wealthy alike. The lack of resistance from Chinese troops and civilians in Nanking meant that the Japanese soldiers were free to divide up the city's valuables as they saw fit. This resulted in the widespread looting and burglary.&lt;ref name=RapeOfNankingP162&gt;

On 17 December, [[John Rabe]] wrote as chairman a complaint to Kiyoshi Fukui, second secretary of the Japanese Embassy. The following is an excerpt:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In other words, on the 13th when your troops entered the city, we had nearly all the civilian population gathered in a Zone in which there had been very little destruction by stray shells and no looting by Chinese soldiers even in full retreat&amp;nbsp;... All 27 Occidentals in the city at that time and our Chinese population were totally surprised by the reign of robbery, raping and killing initiated by your soldiers on the 14th. All we are asking in our protest is that you restore order among your troops and get the normal city life going as soon as possible. In the latter process we are glad to cooperate in any way we can. But even last night between 8 and 9 p.m. when five Occidentals members of our staff and Committee toured the Zone to observe conditions, we did not find any single Japanese patrol either in the Zone or at the entrances!&lt;ref name=GoodMan(271-274)&gt;{{cite book | first = John E. | last = Woods | title = The Good man of Nanking, the Diaries of John Rabe | year = 1998 | page = 271}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Nanking Safety Zone and the role of foreigners ===

The Japanese troops did respect the Zone to an extent; no shells entered that part of the city leading up to the Japanese occupation except a few stray shots. During the chaos following the attack of the city, some were killed in the Safety Zone, but the crimes that took place in the rest of the city were far greater by all accounts.

The Japanese soldiers committed actions in the Safety Zone that were part of the larger Nanking Massacre. The International Committee appealed a number of times to the Japanese army, with [[John Rabe]] using his credentials as a [[Nazi Party]] member, but to no avail. Rabe wrote that from time to time the Japanese would enter the Safety Zone at will, carry off a few hundred men and women, and either summarily execute them or rape and then kill them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = John E. | last = Woods | title = The Good man of Nanking, the Diaries of John Rabe | year = 1998 | page = 274}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By February 5, 1938, the [[International Committee for the Nanking Safety Zone|International Committee]] had forwarded to the Japanese embassy a total of 450 cases of murder, rape, and general disorder by Japanese soldiers that had been reported after the American, British and German diplomats had returned to their embassies.&lt;ref name=Woods275-278&gt;{{cite book | first = John E. | last = Woods | title = The Good man of Nanking, the Diaries of John Rabe | year = 1998 | pages = 275–278}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&quot;Case 5- On the night of December 14th, there were many cases of Japanese soldiers entering houses and raping women or taking them away. This created panic in the area and hundreds of women moved into the Ginling College campus yesterday.&quot;&lt;ref name=Woods275-278 /&gt;

:&quot;Case 19 – January 30th, about 5 p.m. Mr. Sone (of the Nanking Theological Seminary) was greeted by several hundred women pleading with him that they would not have to go home on February 4th. They said it was no use going home they might just as well be killed for staying at the camp as to be raped, robbed or killed at home. (...) One old woman 62 years old went home near Hansimen and Japanese soldiers came at night and wanted to rape her. She said she was too old. So the soldiers rammed a stick up her. But she survived to come back.&quot;&lt;ref name=Woods275-278 /&gt;

=== Causes ===

[[Jonathan Spence]] writes &quot;there is no obvious explanation for this grim event, nor can one be found.  The Japanese soldiers, who had expected easy victory, instead had been fighting hard for months and had taken infinitely higher casualties than anticipated.  They were bored, angry, frustrated, tired.  The Chinese women were undefended, their menfolk powerless or absent.  The war, still undeclared, had no clear-cut goal or purpose.  Perhaps all Chinese, regardless of sex or age, seemed marked out as victims.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Spence, Jonathan D. (1999) ''The Search for Modern China'', W.W. Norton and Company. p. 424. ISBN 0-393-97351-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Matsui's reaction to the massacre ==

On December 18, 1937, as General [[Iwane Matsui]] began to comprehend the full extent of the rape, murder, and looting in the city, he grew increasingly dismayed. He reportedly told one of his civilian aides: &quot;I now realize that we have unknowingly wrought a most grievous effect on this city. When I think of the feelings and sentiments of many of my Chinese friends who have fled from Nanking and of the future of the two countries, I cannot but feel depressed. I am very lonely and can never get in a mood to rejoice about this victory.&quot; He even let a tinge of regret flavor the statement he released to the press that morning: &quot;I personally feel sorry for the tragedies to the people, but the Army must continue unless China repents. Now, in the winter, the season gives time to reflect. I offer my sympathy, with deep emotion, to a million innocent people.&quot;  On New Year's Day, Matsui was still upset about the behavior of the Japanese soldiers at Nanking. Over a toast he confided to a Japanese diplomat: &quot;My men have done something very wrong and extremely regrettable.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Iris | last = Chang | title = The Rape of Nanking: The Forgotten Holocaust | pages = 51–52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== End of the massacre ==

In late January 1938, the Japanese army forced all refugees in the Safety Zone to return home, immediately claiming to have &quot;restored order&quot;.

After the establishment of the “weixin zhengfu” (the collaborating government) in 1938, order was gradually restored in Nanking and atrocities by Japanese troops lessened considerably.

On February 18, 1938, the Nanking Safety Zone International Committee was forcibly renamed &lt;!--not sure by whom, probably IJA--&gt;&quot;''Nanking International Rescue Committee''&quot;, and the Safety Zone effectively ceased to function. The last refugee camps were closed in May 1938.

== Recall of Matsui and Asaka ==

In February 1938 both Prince Asaka and General Matsui were recalled to Japan. Matsui returned to retirement, but Prince Asaka remained on the Supreme War Council until the end of the war in August 1945. He was promoted to the rank of [[general]] in August 1939, though he held no further military commands.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chen, World War II Database&quot;/&gt;

== Death toll estimates ==

Estimates of the number of victims vary based on the definitions of the geographical range and the duration of the event.

According to the [[International Military Tribunal for the Far East]], estimates made at a later date indicate that the total number of civilians and prisoners of war murdered in Nanking and its vicinity during the first six weeks of the Japanese occupation was over 200,000. These estimates are borne out by the figures of burial societies and other organizations, which testify to over 155,000 buried bodies. These figures do not take into account those persons whose bodies were destroyed by burning, drowning or by other means, or whose bodies were interred in mass graves.&lt;ref name=&quot;IMTftFE&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/PTO/IMTFE/IMTFE-8.html | title = HyperWar: International Military Tribunal for the Far East (Chapter 8) (Paragraph 2, p. 1015, Judgment International Military Tribunal for the Far East) | accessdate = 2007  December}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the verdict of the [[Nanjing War Crimes Tribunal]] on 10 March 1947, there are &quot;more than 190,000 mass slaughtered civilians and Chinese soldiers killed by machine gun by the Japanese army, whose corpses have been burned to destroy proof. Besides, we count more than 150,000 victims of barbarian acts buried by the charity organizations. We thus have a total of more than 300,000 victims.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kasahara&quot;&gt;[[Tokushi Kasahara]].

Historian Tokushi Kasahara states &quot;more than 100,000 and close to 200,000, or maybe more&quot;, referring to his own book.&lt;ref&gt;Iwanami Shinsho, Fujiwara Akira (editor). ''Nankin jiken O Dou Miruka'', 1998, Aoki shoten, ISBN 4-250-98016-2, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; This estimation includes the surrounding area outside of the city of Nanking, which is objected by a Chinese researcher (the same book, p.&amp;nbsp;146). Hiroshi Yoshida concludes &quot;more than 200,000&quot; in his book.&lt;ref&gt;Yoshida, Hiroshi. &quot;Nankin jiken o dou miruka'' p. 123, ''Tennou no guntai to Nankin jiken'' 1998, Aoki shoten, p. 160, ISBN 4-250-98019-7.&lt;/ref&gt; Tomio Hora writes of 50,000–100,000 deaths.&lt;ref&gt;Tanaka Masaaki [http://www.sdh-fact.com/  ''What Really Happened in Nanking''], Sekai Shuppan, Inc., 2000, ISBN 4-916079-07-8, p. 5).&lt;/ref&gt;

Other nations  believe the death toll to be between 150,000–300,000, based on the [[Nanjing War Crimes Tribunal]] verdict, and another estimate of the civilian toll (excluding soldiers and POWs) is about 40,000–60,000, which corresponds to the figures from three sources; one is the Red Army's official journal of the time, Hangdibao and another is that of Miner Searle Bates of the International Safety Zone Committee, and the third is the aforementioned figure written by John Rabe in a letter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.wellesley.edu/Polisci/wj/China/Nanjing/nanjing2.html | title = '&amp;#39;The Nanking Atrocities: Fact and Fable'&amp;#39; | publisher = Wellesley.edu | date = | accessdate = 2011-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The casualty count of 300,000 was first promulgated in January 1938 by [[Harold Timperley]], a journalist in China during the Japanese invasion, based on reports from contemporary eyewitnesses.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} Other sources, including [[Iris Chang]]'s ''[[The Rape of Nanking (book)|The Rape of Nanking]]'', also conclude that the death toll reached 300,000. In December 2007, newly declassified [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]] archive documents revealed that a telegraph by the U.S. ambassador to Germany in Berlin sent one day after the Japanese army occupied Nanking, stated that he heard the Japanese Ambassador in Germany boasting that Japanese army killed 500,000 Chinese people as the Japanese army advanced from Shanghai to Nanking. According to the archives research &quot;The telegrams sent by the U.S. diplomats [in Berlin] pointed to the massacre of an estimated half a million people in Shanghai, Suzhou, Jiaxing, Hangzhou, Shaoxing, Wuxi and Changzhou&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;December 2007&quot;&gt;

=== Range and duration ===

The most conservative viewpoint is that the geographical area of the incident should be limited to the few km&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt; of the city known as the Safety Zone, where the civilians gathered after the invasion. Many Japanese historians seized upon the fact that during the Japanese invasion there were only 200,000–250,000 citizens in Nanking as reported by John Rabe, to argue that the PRC's estimate of 300,000 deaths is a vast exaggeration.

However, many historians include a much larger area around the city.  Including the Xiaguan district (the [[suburb]]s north of Nanking, about 31&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt; in size) and other areas on the outskirts of the city, the population of greater Nanking was running between 535,000 and 635,000 civilians and soldiers just prior to the  Japanese occupation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Data Challenges Japanese Theory on Nanjing Population Size | url = http://www.china.org.cn/english/2003/Dec/83437.htm | accessdate = 2006-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some historians also include six counties around Nanking, known as the Nanking Special Municipality.

The duration of the incident is naturally defined by its geography: the earlier the Japanese entered the area, the longer the duration. The [[Battle of Nanjing|Battle of Nanking]] ended on December 13, when the divisions of the Japanese Army entered the walled city of Nanking. The Tokyo War Crime Tribunal defined the period of the massacre to the ensuing six weeks. More conservative estimates say that the massacre started on December 14, when the troops entered the Safety Zone, and that it lasted for six weeks. Historians who define the Nanking Massacre as having started from the time that the Japanese Army entered [[Jiangsu]] province push the beginning of the massacre to around mid-November to early December (Suzhou fell on November 19), and stretch the end of the massacre to late March 1938.

=== Various estimates ===

Japanese historians, depending on their definition of the geographical and time duration of the killings, give wide-ranging estimates for the number of massacred civilians, from several thousand to upwards of 200,000.&lt;ref name=japanesestudies&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.japanesestudies.org.uk/articles/Askew.html | title = Electronic journal of contemporary japanese studies (ejcjs): The Nanjing Incident: Recent Research and Trends | publisher = japanesestudies.org.uk | date = | accessdate = 2011-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chinese language sources tend to place the figure of massacred civilians upwards of 200,000.&lt;ref name=japanesestudies /&gt;  For example, a postwar investigation by the Nanking District Court put the number of dead during the incident as 295,525, 76% of them men, 22% women and 2% children.

A 42-part [[Taiwan]]ese documentary produced from 1995 to 1997, entitled ''An Inch of Blood For An Inch of Land''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huanghuagang.org/library/heshan.htm 一寸河山一寸血――42集电视纪录片&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; (一寸河山一寸血), asserts that 340,000 Chinese civilians died in Nanking City as a result of the Japanese invasion, 150,000 through bombing and crossfire in the five-day battle, and 190,000 in the massacre, based on the evidence presented at the Tokyo Trials.

== War crimes tribunals ==

Shortly after the surrender of Japan, the primary officers in charge of the Japanese troops at Nanking were put on trial.   General Matsui was indicted before the [[International Military Tribunal for the Far East]] for &quot;deliberately and recklessly&quot; ignoring his legal duty &quot;to take adequate steps to secure the observance and prevent breaches&quot; of the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907|Hague Convention]]. [[Hisao Tani]], the lieutenant general of the 6th Division of the Japanese army in Nanking, was tried by the [[Nanjing War Crimes Tribunal]].

Other Japanese military leaders in charge at the time of the Nanking Massacre were not tried. [[Prince Kan'in]], chief of staff of the Imperial Japanese Army during the massacre, had died before the end of the war in May 1945. Prince Asaka was granted immunity because of his status as a member of the imperial family.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Bix, ''Hirohito and the Making of Modern Japan'', 2000, p.583, John Dower, ''Embracing Defeat: Japan in the Wake of World War II'', 1999, p.326.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Isamu Chō]], the aide of Prince Asaka, and whom some historians believe issued the &quot;kill all captives&quot; memo, had committed suicide during the defense of Okinawa.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas M.

&lt;/gallery&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

=== Grant of immunity to Prince Asaka ===

On May 1, 1946, [[Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers|SCAP]] officials interrogated [[Prince Asaka]], who was the ranking officer in the city at the height of the atrocities, about his involvement in the Nanking Massacre and the deposition was submitted to the International Prosecution Section of the Tokyo tribunal. Asaka denied the existence of any massacre and claimed never to have received complaints about the conduct of his troops.&lt;ref&gt;

Awaya Kentarô, Yoshida Yutaka, ''Kokusai kensatsukyoku jinmonchôsho'', dai 8 kan, Nihon Tosho Centâ, 1993., Case 44, pp. 358–66.

&lt;/ref&gt; Whatever his culpability may have been, Asaka was not prosecuted  before the [[International Military Tribunal for the Far East]] at least in part because under the pact concluded between [[Douglas MacArthur|General MacArthur]] and [[Hirohito]], the Emperor himself and all the members of the imperial family were granted immunity from prosecution.

The prosecution began the Nanking phase of its case in July 1946.  Dr. [[Robert O. Wilson]], a surgeon and a member of the International Committee for the Nanking Safety Zone, took the witness stand first.

Other members of the International Committee for the Nanking Safety Zone who took the witness stand included [[Miner Searle Bates]] and [[John Magee (missionary)|John Magee]]. [[George A. Fitch]], [[Lewis Smythe]] and James McCallum filed affidavits with their diaries and letters.

Another piece of evidence that was submitted to the tribunal was Harold Timperley's telegram regarding the Nanking Massacre which had been intercepted and decoded by the Americans on January 17, 1938.

One of the books by Hsü, Documents of the Nanking Safety Zone, was also [[adduced]] in court.

According to Matsui's own diary, one day after he made the ceremonial triumphal entry into the city on December 17, 1937, he instructed the chiefs of staff from each division to tighten military discipline and try to eradicate the sense of disdain for Chinese people among their soldiers.

On February 7, 1938, Matsui delivered a speech at a memorial service for the Japanese officers and men of the Shanghai Expeditionary Force who were killed in action. In front of the high-ranking officers, Domei News Agency reported, he emphasized the necessity to &quot;put an end to various reports affecting the prestige of the Japanese troops.&quot;

The entry for the same day in Matsui's diary read, &quot;I could only feel sadness and responsibility today, which has been overwhelmingly piercing my heart. This is caused by the Army's misbehaviors after the fall of Nanking and failure to proceed with the autonomous government and other political plans.&quot;

=== Matsui's defense ===

Matsui's defence varied between denying the mass-scale atrocities and evading his responsibility for what had happened. Eventually he ended up making numerous conflicting statements.

In the interrogation in Sugamo prison preceding the trial Matsui admitted that he heard about the many outrages committed by his troops from Japanese diplomats when he entered Nanking on December 17, 1937.

In court, he contradicted the earlier testimony and told the judges that he was not &quot;officially&quot; briefed at the consulate about the evildoings, presumably to avoid admitting any contact with the consulate officials such as Second Secretary (later Acting Consul-General) Fukui Kiyoshi and Attaché Fukuda Tokuyasu who received and dealt with the protests filed by the International Committee.

In the same interrogation session before the trial Matsui said one officer and three low-ranking soldiers were court-martialled because of their misbehavior in Nanking and the officer was sentenced to death.

In his affidavit Matsui said he ordered his officers to investigate the massacre and to take necessary action. In court, however, Matsui said that he did not have jurisdiction over the soldiers' misconduct since he was not in the position of supervising military discipline and morals.

Matsui asserted that he had never ordered the execution of Chinese [[Prisoner of war|POWs]].  He further argued that he had directed his army division commanders to discipline their troops for criminal acts, and was not responsible for their failure to carry out his directives.  At trial, Matsui went out of his way to protect [[Prince Asaka]] by shifting blame to lower ranking division commanders.&lt;ref name=Bix&gt;{{cite journal |first=Herbert |last=Bix |title=Hirohito and the Making of Modern Japan |journal=Perennial |year=2001 |page=734}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Verdict ===

In the end the Tribunal convicted only two defendants to the Rape of Nanking.

Matsui was convicted of count 55, which charged him with being one of the senior officers who &quot;deliberately and recklessly disregarded their legal duty [by virtue of their respective offices] to take adequate steps to secure the observance [of the Laws and Customs of War] and prevent breaches thereof, and thereby violated the laws of war.&quot;

Hirota Koki, who had been the Foreign Minister when Japan conquered Nanking, was convicted of participating in &quot;the formulation or execution of a common plan or conspiracy&quot; (count 1), waging &quot;a war of aggression and a war in violation of international laws, treaties, agreements and assurances against the Republic of China&quot; (count 27) and count 55.

Matsui was convicted by a majority of the judges at the Tokyo tribunal who ruled that he bore ultimate responsibility for the &quot;orgy of crime&quot; at Nanking because, &quot;He did nothing, or nothing effective, to abate these horrors.&quot;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Organized and wholesale murder of male civilians was conducted with the apparent sanction of the commanders on the pretext that Chinese soldiers had removed their uniforms and were mingling with the population.  Groups of Chinese civilians were formed, bound with their  hands behind their backs, and marched outside the walls of the city where they were killed in groups by machine gun fire and with bayonets. --- From Judgment of the International Military Tribunal
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Radhabinod Pal]], the member of the tribunal  from India, dissented from the conviction arguing that the commander-in-chief must rely on his subordinate officers to enforce soldier discipline. &quot;The name of Justice,&quot; Pal wrote in his dissent, &quot;should not be allowed to be invoked only for ... vindictive retaliation.&quot;

=== Sentence ===

On November 12, 1948, Matsui and Hirota, along with five other convicted Class-A war criminals, were sentenced to death by hanging. Eighteen others received lesser sentences. The death sentence imposed on Hirota, a six-to-five decision by the eleven judges, shocked the general public and prompted a petition on his behalf, which soon gathered over 300,000 signatures but did not succeed in commuting the Minister's sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dower|first=John|title=Embracing defeat: Japan in the wake of World War II |year=2000 |publisher=Norton |location=New York |isbn=978-0-393-32027-5 |page=459 |edition=Paperback ed.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brackman |first=Arnold C. |title=The other Nuremberg: the untold story of the Tokyo war trials |year=1988 |publisher=Quill |location=New York |isbn=0-688-07957-1 |pages=395}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Memorials ==

In 1985, the [[Nanjing Massacre Memorial Hall]] was built by the Nanking Municipal Government in remembrance of the victims and to raise awareness of the Nanking Massacre. It is located near a site where thousands of bodies were buried, called the &quot;pit of ten thousand corpses&quot; (''wàn rén kēng'').

In 1995, Daniel Kwan held a photograph exhibit in Los Angeles titled, &quot;The Forgotten Holocaust&quot;.

In 2005, John Rabe's former residence in Nanking was renovated and now accommodates the &quot;[[John Rabe House|John Rabe and International Safety Zone Memorial Hall]]&quot;, which opened in 2006.

== Controversy ==
{{Main|Nanking Massacre denial}}
{{Further|Historiography of the Nanking Massacre}}

China and Japan have both acknowledged the occurrence of wartime atrocities.  Disputes over the historical portrayal of these events continue to cause tensions between Japan on one side and China and other East Asian countries on the other side.

=== Cold War ===

Before the 1970s, China did relatively little to draw attention to the Nanking massacre. In her book ''Rape of Nanking'' Iris Chang asserted that the politics of the [[Cold War]] encouraged Mao to stay relatively silent about Nanking in order to keep a trade relationship with Japan. In turn, China and Japan occasionally used Nanking as an opportunity to demonize one another.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

=== Debate in Japan ===

The major waves of Japanese treatment of these events have ranged from total cover-up during the war, confessions and documentation by the Japanese soldiers during the 1950s and 1960s, minimization of the extent of the Nanking Massacre during the 1970s and 1980s, official Japanese government distortion and rewriting of history during the 1980s, and total denial of the occurrence of the Nanking Massacre by some government officials in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.cnd.org/mirror/nanjing/NMNJ.html | title = Basic facts on the Nanking Massacre and the Tokyo War Crimes Trial | year = 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The debate concerning the massacre took place mainly in the 1970s. During this time, the Chinese government's statements about the event were attacked by the Japanese because they were said to rely too heavily on personal testimonies and anecdotal evidence. Aspersions were cast regarding the authenticity and accuracy of burial records and photographs presented in the Tokyo War Crime Court, which were said to be fabrications by the Chinese government, artificially manipulated or incorrectly attributed to the Nanking Massacre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ne.jp/asahi/unko/tamezou/nankin/fiction/index.html | title = The Nanking Massacre: Fact Versus Fiction | accessdate = 2008-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1970s, [[Katsuichi Honda]] wrote a series of articles for the ''[[Asahi Shimbun]]'' on war crimes committed by Japanese soldiers during [[World War II]] (such as the Nanking Massacre).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Katsuich |last=Honda |title=Chūgoku no Tabi&quot; (中国の旅, &quot;Travels in China&quot; |journal=[[Asahi Shimbun]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The publication of these articles triggered a vehement response from Japanese right-wingers regarding the Japanese treatment of the war crimes.  In response, Shichihei Yamamoto&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Reply to Katsuichi Honda |first=Shichihei |last=Yamamoto |journal=Every Gentlemen |date=March 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and Akira Suzuki&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Phantom of The Nanjing Massacre |first=Akira |last=Suzuki |journal=Every Gentlemen |date=April 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt; wrote two controversial yet influential articles which sparked the negationist movement.

=== Apology and condolences by the Prime Minister and Emperor of Japan ===
{{See also|List of war apology statements issued by Japan}}

On August 15, 1995, the fiftieth anniversary of the [[Surrender of Japan]], the Japanese prime minister [[Tomiichi Murayama]] gave the first clear and formal apology for Japanese actions during the war.  He apologized for Japan's wrongful aggression and the great suffering that it inflicted in Asia.  He offered his heartfelt apology to all survivors and to the relatives and friends of the victims. That day, the prime minister and the Japanese Emperor [[Akihito]] pronounced statements of mourning at Tokyo's [[Nippon Budokan]]. The emperor offered his condolences and expressed the hope that such atrocities would never be repeated. [[Iris Chang]], author of ''[[The Rape of Nanking (book)|The Rape of Nanking]]'', criticized Murayama for not providing the written apology that had been expected. She said that the people of China &quot;don't believe that an... unequivocal and sincere apology has ever been made by Japan to China&quot; and that a written apology from Japan would send a better message to the international community.&lt;ref name=&quot;I'm Sorry&quot;/&gt;

=== Denials of the massacre by public officials in Japan ===

In May 1994, Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano called the Nanjing Massacre a &quot;fabrication&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20120223a5.html| author= Jun Hongo| title=Nagoya mayor won't budge on Nanjing remark| publisher=Japan Times| date=23 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 19, 2007, a group of around 100 [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|Liberal Democratic Party]] (LDP) lawmakers again denounced the Nanjing Massacre as a fabrication, arguing that there was no evidence to prove the allegations of mass killings by Japanese soldiers.  They accused Beijing of using the alleged incident as a &quot;political advertisement&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/T214128.htm |title=Japan ruling MPs call Nanjing massacre fabrication |date=2007-06-19 |accessdate=2009-03-19}}{{dead link|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8RRqyRlRV4 |title= Subcommittee on Nanjing Issues Press Conference (YouTube) |date=2007-06-19 |accessdate=2010-11-23}}{{dead link|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 20, 2012, [[Takashi Kawamura (politician)|Takashi Kawamura]], mayor of [[Nagoya]], told a visiting delegation from Nanjing that the massacre &quot;probably never happened&quot;. Two days later he defended his remarks, saying, &quot;Even since I was a national Diet representative, I have said [repeatedly] there was no [Nanjing] massacre that resulted in murders of several hundred thousands of people.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970203960804577238802680649914.html| author=Josh Chin and Yoree Koh| title=Japanese Official Denies Nanjing Massacre| publisher=Wall Street Journal| date=February 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hongo, Jun, &quot;[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20120223a5.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+japantimes+(The+Japan+Times%3A+All+Stories) Nagoya mayor won't budge on Nanjing remark]&quot;, ''[[Japan Times]]'', 23 February 2012, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 24, 2012, [[Tokyo]] governor [[Shintaro Ishihara]] said that he also believes that the Nanjing massacre never happened. He reportedly claims it would have been impossible to kill so many people in such a short period of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gqqzO2hCm4p_W9kawUJsV85RS1RA?docId=CNG.55872017a52d4f3c1e40d17a3ebe2909.561| title=Tokyo governor backs Nanjing massacre denial| publisher=AFP| date=February 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==

=== Effect on international relations ===

The memory of the Nanking Massacre has been a stumbling block in [[Sino-Japanese relations]] since the early 1970s.  Bilateral exchanges on trade, culture and education have increased greatly since the two countries normalized their bilateral relations and Japan became China’s most important trading partner.&lt;ref&gt;Yuan 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Trade between the two nations is worth over $200 billion annually.  Despite this, many Chinese people still have a strong sense of mistrust and animosity toward Japan that originates from the memory of [[Japanese war crimes]] such as the Nanking Massacre. This sense of mistrust is strengthened by the belief that Japan is unwilling to admit to and apologize for the atrocities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Perspectives |volume= 6| issue =  3 |date=2005-09-30 |last=Pu |first=Xiaoyu |title=The Nanking Massacre, Justice and Reconciliation: A Chinese Perspective |url=http://www.oycf.org/oycfold/httpdocs/Perspectives2/30_09302005/2c_Pu_NankingMassacre.pdf |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5pxfMlhJa |archivedate=2010-05-24 |accessdate=2009-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Takashi Yoshida described how changing political concerns and perceptions of the &quot;national interest&quot; in Japan, China, and Western countries have shaped collective memory of the Nanking massacre. Yoshida asserted that over time the event has acquired different meanings to different people.&lt;ref&gt;Nanking 1937: Memory and Healing, edited by Fei Fei Li, Robert Sabella and David Liu (M.E. Sharpe, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Japanese prime ministers have visited the [[Yasukuni Shrine]], a shrine for dead Japanese soldiers of [[World War II]], including some war criminals of the Nanking Massacre. In the museum adjacent to the shrine, a panel informs visitors that there was no massacre in Nanjing, but that Chinese soldiers in plain clothes were &quot;dealt with severely&quot;. In 2006 former Japanese prime minister [[Junichiro Koizumi]] made a pilgrimage to the shrine despite warnings from China and South Korea. His decision to visit the shrine regardless sparked international outrage. Although Koizumi denied that he was trying to glorify war or historical [[Japanese militarism]], The Chinese Foreign Ministry accused Koizumi of &quot;wrecking the political foundations of China-Japan relations&quot;. An official from South Korea said they would summon the Tokyo ambassador to protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/world/fury-as-koizumi-honours-war-dead/2006/08/15/1155407790276.html | location=Melbourne | work=The Age | title=Fury as Koizumi honours war dead | date=August 15, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english1.people.com.cn/english/200106/01/eng20010601_71508.html |title=Japanese Leader's Decision to Visit Yasukuni Shrine Puzzling: FM Spokesman |publisher=English1.people.com.cn |date=2001-06-01 |accessdate=2011-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/1214/p04s01-woap.html |title=In Japan, denial over Nanjing still holds sway after 70 years |publisher=The Christian Science Monitor - CSMonitor.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.china.org.cn/english/features/135371.htm |title=The 14 Class-A War Criminals Enshrined at Yasukuni |publisher=China.org.cn |date= |accessdate=2011-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== As a component of national identity ===

Takashi Yoshida asserts that, &quot;Nanking has figured in the attempts of all three nations [China, Japan and the United States] to preserve and redefine national and ethnic pride and identity, assuming different kinds of significance based on each country's changing internal and external enemies.&quot;&lt;ref name=Yoshida&gt;{{cite book |last=Yoshida |first= Takashi |title=The Making of the &quot;Rape of Nanking  |year=2006 |page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Japan ===
{{Main|Japanese history textbook controversies}}

In Japan, the Nanking Massacre touches upon national identity and notions of &quot;pride, honor and shame.&quot; Yoshida argues that &quot;Nanking crystallizes a much larger conflict over what should constitute the ideal perception of the nation: Japan, as a nation, acknowledges its past and apologizes for its wartime wrongdoings; or . . . stands firm against foreign pressures and teaches Japanese youth about the benevolent and courageous martyrs who fought a just war to save Asia from Western aggression.&quot;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite book |last=Yoshida |first= Takashi |title=The Making of the &quot;Rape of Nanking  |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recognizing the Nanking Massacre as such can be viewed in some circles in Japan as &quot;Japan bashing&quot; (in the case of foreigners) or &quot;self-flagellation&quot; (in the case of Japanese).

The majority of Japanese acknowledge the IJA committed atrocities during the Nanking Massacre. Some denialists and Japanese officials have openly denied the incident, claiming it to be propaganda designed to spark an anti-Japan movement. In many ways, how &quot;atrocious&quot; the massacre was is the touchstone of left/right divide in Japan; i.e., leftists feel this is a defining moment of the IJA; rightists believe Perry's opening of Japan and the atomic bombings are far more significant events.

=== China ===

The Nanking massacre has emerged as a fundamental keystone in the construction of the modern Chinese national identity.&lt;ref name=Askew&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.japanesestudies.org.uk/articles/Askew.html#_edn2 |title=The Nanjing Incident – Recent Research and Trends |first=David |last=Askew |date=2002-04-04 |accessdate=2009-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern Chinese (including citizens of the PRC, Taiwan, and overseas) will refer to the Nanking Massacre to explain certain stances they hold or ideas they have; this 'national unifying event' holds true to middle-school educated peasants and to senior government officials alike.

===Records===
In December 2007, the PRC government published the names of 13,000 people who were killed by Japanese troops in the Nanking Massacre.  According to [[Xinhua News Agency]], it is the most complete record to date.&lt;ref name=&quot;2007report&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7126455.stm|title=Nanjing massacre victims named|publisher=BBC News|date=2007-12-04|accessdate=2007-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The report consists of eight volumes and was released to mark the 70th anniversary of the start of the massacre.  It also lists the Japanese army units that were responsible for each of the deaths and states the way in which the victims were killed.  Zhang Xianwen, editor-in-chief of the report, states that the information collected was based on &quot;a combination of Chinese, Japanese and Western raw materials, which is objective and just and is able to stand the trial of history.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;2007report&quot; /&gt;  This report formed part of a 55-volume series (Collection of Historical Materials of Nanjing Massacre ([[:zh:南京大屠殺史料集|南京大屠杀史料集]]) about the massacre.
